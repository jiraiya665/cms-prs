(If unavailable, the old default is used.)\r\n\r\nI have specified the protocol selection should go in a new \"cms\" section of the `.gitconfig`, to avoid conflicts with any other settings.\r\n\r\nI also noticed there was no man page for `git-cms-init`, so I added one, with a note about the `.gitconfig` protocol setting.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 0, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1558725665", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "externals-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "number": 104, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Get default protocol from git config", "updated_at": "1558725695", "user": "kpedro88"}
