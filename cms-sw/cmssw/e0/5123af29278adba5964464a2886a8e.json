There are no changes expected.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 38, "comments": 24, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1563202997", "deletions": 804, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27522, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "New GsfEleEBEECut class to generalize some ElectronIdentification cuts", "updated_at": "1564520746", "user": "guitargeek"}
