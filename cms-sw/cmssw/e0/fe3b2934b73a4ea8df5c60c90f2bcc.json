This required modifying the SiStripClusterInfo helper class.\r\n\r\nModified all the other clients of SiStripClusterInfo also to keep working with the changes in the helper class, but I didn't finish the migration for those other modules because I am not sure which are actually still used. But the part using SiStripClusterInfo is migrated now.\r\n\r\nNote that I deleted the reclusterize function from SiStripClusterInfo. Nothing in the repository used that function and it seemed an odd place to run clusterization from anyway. I deleted it because the reclusterize function used EventSetup and removing that postpones the EventSetup consumes migration of that algorithm until we migrate the module that actually runs it.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRelies on existing tests. There is no new functionality. All results should be identical if I've done this correctly.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 15, "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1577384638", "deletions": 328, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28683, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "EventSetup consumes migration, SiStrip modules", "updated_at": "1577730182", "user": "wddgit"}
