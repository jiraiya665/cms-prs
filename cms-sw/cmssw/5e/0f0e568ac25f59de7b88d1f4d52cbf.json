It becomes the \"final\" particleFlow module after linking. There are therefore now two \"particleFlowTmp\" objects (Tmp and Tmp2). \r\n\r\nThis is the first in an expected long sequence of follow-on PRs that will make use of PUPPI in RECO, simplifying many downstream workflows. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l limited\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe expected PUPPI weights are present in the PFCandidates and are used (for now) only for ak4PFPuppi and ak8PFPuppi. \r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nNo backports are planned.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 40, "comments": 44, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1576786158", "deletions": 360, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-rejected", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28659, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 40, "state": "open", "title": "PUPPI in RECO", "updated_at": "1579786419", "user": "rappoccio"}
