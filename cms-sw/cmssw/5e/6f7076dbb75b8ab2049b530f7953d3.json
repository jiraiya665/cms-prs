Although the basic workflows run smoothly, when the ```-i all``` is used for runTheMatrix.py in IB , 1370.0,1370.17 and 1370.18 fail due to the fact that the generator part is split in two, and the standard logic of PyReleaseValidation fail, see issue #27248. A simple workaround is to force these workflows to be always fully executed, regardless of the input option (to be verified the possible impact on resources). \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAll the pLHE workflows have been verified to pass the first two steps both with and without the ```-i all``` option of runTheMatrix.py.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 8, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1561024219", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27285, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Prevent pLHE workflows to start from input files ", "updated_at": "1561025121", "user": "fabiocos"}
