I included here core packages that I will be changing in my concurrent IOV pull request, because I want to rebase that on top of this. More PRs for other core packages coming soon.\r\n\r\nThere were a few addition changes that showed up in code-checks. I had to manually fix one line to get it to compile.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe only test I performed was checking that the revised packages compile and build.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 697, "comments": 1, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1556646657", "deletions": 52816, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "core-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26579, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Framework code format", "updated_at": "1556646728", "user": "wddgit"}
