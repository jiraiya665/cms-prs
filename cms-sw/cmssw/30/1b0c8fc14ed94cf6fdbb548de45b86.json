This improvement is targeting the 2016 UL campaign.\r\n\r\n- A set of APV baseline distributions, which represent the charge accumulated on a strip over several bunch crossings, are provided as an input\r\n  - These are stored as text files in SimTracker/SiStripDigitizer/data/\r\n  - Are read in a similar way to the APV pulse shape\r\n  - These are provided per layer, and in bins of PU and z within a layer, and are \"unrolled\" as one long array of numbers in the text files.\r\n- Each time a charge is deposited on a strip, the APV response is simulated.  This is linear for low APV baselines (little charge remaining on strip from previous interactions), but becomes non-linear for high APV baselines.\r\n  - The end effect reduces the charge that is effectively deposited/read out from a strip\r\n- The dynamic gain simulation is currently turned off in this PR\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n- Validation is still ongoing, but an improved description of the shapes of the cluster charge distribution and cluster multiplicity is seen with these changes.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 34, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1566477825", "deletions": 17, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27823, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 31, "state": "open", "title": "Simulation of APV dynamic gain", "updated_at": "1568283031", "user": "EmyrClement"}
