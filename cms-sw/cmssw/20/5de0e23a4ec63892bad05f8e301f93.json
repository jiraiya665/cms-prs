Nothing in production runs with more than 1 concurrent lumis yet, so I am guessing the impact of this bug has been small. Outside of Core tests, the only modules in the CMSSW repository using this cache at this point in time are HLTriggerJSONMonitoring and L1TriggerJSONMonitoring.\r\n\r\nThis fixes the problem reported by Srecko Morovic on the Framework hyper news on 10/31/19.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAdded a new Core unit test to verify correct behavior. This test would have detected the original problem reported.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 22, "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1573154599", "deletions": 49, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "core-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28362, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix LuminosityBlockSummaryCache & concurrent lumis", "updated_at": "1573165792", "user": "wddgit"}
