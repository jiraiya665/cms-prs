We will investigate, but that's independent of the PR.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1559827666", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-notrun", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-rejected", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27128, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Extend and fix RecHitTools", "updated_at": "1559838590", "user": "clelange"}
