Downloading the DQMIO files before running the job should no longer be required (the input source now supports opening remote files), but it still helps to remove some unknowns from the test setup.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNo changes to existing workflows. `dqmiofilecopy.py` still works to download DQMIO files when supplied with a dataset currently on disk.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1582019063", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28986, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "DQM: Re-add harvesting test tools.", "updated_at": "1582637300", "user": "schneiml"}
