This prompted me to check for their usage, and there is a misleading piece of code in the HI reco where a EcalClusterShapeFunction is created and passed around, but never actually used. It's probably better to remove this. On the way I also removed a few more unneeded includes of `EcalClusterFunctionBaseClass.h` and `EcalClusterFunctionFactory.h`, placed a few `const` and replaced a variable called `theAlgo` with `algoId`, to not get it confused for a member variable.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles and local matrix tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "comments": 17, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1574206736", "deletions": 209, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28428, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "open", "title": "No actual use for EcalClusterShapeFunction in HiEgammaAlgos", "updated_at": "1574274311", "user": "guitargeek"}
