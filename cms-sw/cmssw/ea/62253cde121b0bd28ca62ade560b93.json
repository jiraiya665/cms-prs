This was needed as the batch submissions will no longer be supported.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nSubmission does not change to the user side of view. The code has been tested against different cases of DAGman failures (unexpected failures of the DAGman submission, unexpected stops of the DAGman job, known failures resulting in rescue files).\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1559646625", "deletions": 124, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27092, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "TkAlignment HipPy condor submission", "updated_at": "1559647254", "user": "SenneVanPutte"}
