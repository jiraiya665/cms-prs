This is done by requiring the `T` to have a nested type `Tokens` that then does the `consumes` call and holds the `ESGetToken`s and is then passed to the constructor of `T` (in case `T` does not consume any ESProducts, it can define `Tokens` as `void` and have no further effect).\r\n\r\nIn principle I think a \"maker\" pattern would have been more applicable (`T` would be a \"maker\" that would be used to produce the concrete `JetTagComputer` in `JetTagComputerESProducer<T>::produce()`), but that would have been much heavier refactoring to which I did not want to go.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 25, "comments": 23, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1562131490", "deletions": 161, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27430, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Use ESGetToken in JetTagComputerESProducer<T>", "updated_at": "1562153529", "user": "makortel"}
