This means that trigger pad clusters will not be produced in the L1-trigger chain during Phase-2. This is the currently the case in the simulation though. In Phase-2, ME0 triggers will be constructed out of trigger pads directly. This PR updates the simulation accordingly. More details can be found in this presentation: https://indico.cern.ch/event/831338/contributions/3482241/attachments/1869796/3079349/Change-ME0-001_CMS_Black.pdf. \r\n\r\nI added a flag in the configuration to choose the input (pad or pad cluster). Other modifications include additional member data and a function that was templated. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI ran the workflow 20034.0 successfully.  \r\n\r\nFYI: @jshlee @tahuang1991 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1565280706", "deletions": 48, "labels": ["code-checks-rejected", "comparison-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27731, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Allow for ME0 triggers to be produced from pads directly", "updated_at": "1565281197", "user": "dildick"}
