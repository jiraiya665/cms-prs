This is the second in a series of such PRs\r\n(more are on the way).\r\n\r\nThere is a considerable amount of cleanup mixed in with\r\nthis. Headers fixed, commented code removed, cout lines\r\nremoved, event counters removed, .h content moved to\r\n.cc files,  destructors just defaulted, esConsumes migration\r\ndone for one module...\r\n\r\nThe intent is nothing has been done that would change\r\nthe filter behavior and in fact the changes to the\r\nalgorithmic code in the filter methods are very small.\r\nI didn't touch any complicated logical code.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRelying on existing tests. Behavior should not change.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 21, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1582064239", "deletions": 1019, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "generators-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28991, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Migrate 10 EDFilters in GenFilters from legacy", "updated_at": "1582064278", "user": "wddgit"}
