Of course they are not fully correct yet as they are not the 2018UL corrections.\r\n\r\nAlso from looking around at the modifiers it appears Run3 activates the egamma 2018 modifier so Run3 also gets this. Which is good, they should be using this.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 80, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1564492251", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27644, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "enabling UL regression for 2018 (and likely Run3)", "updated_at": "1565604998", "user": "Sam-Harper"}
