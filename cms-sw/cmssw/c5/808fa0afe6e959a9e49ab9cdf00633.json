This time I took a look at the EgammaElectronProducers package and made the following cleanups/changes:\r\n\r\n* remove unused python configuration fragment files\r\n* merge some configuration fragment files that only get used at one place anyway\r\n* change the `fillDescriptions` methods of the LowPt* producers to contain what is actually used in the configs so separate `cfi` files are not needed anymore\r\n* implement a `produce` function in the GsfElectronBaseProducer so it can be used directly in configs. This way, the GsfElectronEcalDrivenProducer and LowPtGsfElectronProducer can be removed. They were exact duplicates so one of them should not have existed anyway\r\n* take the SiStripElectron related code out of the release as suggested by @Sam-Harper at some point if I remember correctly\r\n* turn the LowPtGsfElectronIDProducer into a global producer so the `LowPtGsfElectronIDHeavyObjectCache` could be integrated in it. I think that's good because the concept of a HeavyObjectCache is a bit technical, and having the functionality just in a global producer is easier to understand for non-experts\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles and local matrix tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 70, "comments": 27, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1562760568", "deletions": 4311, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27477, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 10, "state": "open", "title": "RecoEgamma/EgammaElectronProducers cleanup", "updated_at": "1563282358", "user": "guitargeek"}
