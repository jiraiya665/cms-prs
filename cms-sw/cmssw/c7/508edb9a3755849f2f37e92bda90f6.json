Recent studies have shown that the current handling of high momentum charged particles in PUPPI is suboptimal compared to CHS and a different configuration of PUPPI for Run3 is proposed.\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/862332/contributions/3632864/\r\nThis PR implements the necessary switches without changing the current behavior of the algorithm, i.e. no changes to RECO+MiniAOD are expected from this PR.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the behavior of the parameter puppiNoLeptons, that is not used anywhere in CMSSW, is adapted such that implementation actually matches the name.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nruntests", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1575550824", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28558, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add parameters for high pT particle protection in PUPPI", "updated_at": "1575571167", "user": "ahinzmann"}
