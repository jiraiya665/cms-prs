I understand\r\nthe problem causing the exception and fixed it.\r\n\r\nI added a call to setIsProvenanceSetOnRead on the\r\nBranchDescription. This has been needed since\r\nPR #28536 for FedRawDataInputSource to work\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUsing the test provided in the issue with the problem\r\nreport, I reproduced the exception and verified the\r\nexception does not occur with the fix in place.\r\n\r\nI somewhat narrowly focused on the reported exception.\r\nIt might be worth it for an expert responsible for\r\nFedRawDataInputSource to verify it is really working.\r\nMaybe the test in the bug report is sufficient, it runs\r\nsuccessfully to completion with the fix.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1579900281", "deletions": 14, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28791, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Bug fix in DaqProvenanceHelper", "updated_at": "1579911474", "user": "wddgit"}
