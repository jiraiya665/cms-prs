It is done in preparation for changes to the CLCT trigger patterns which is anticipated to happen sometime during Run-3. This PR should be integrated after https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/27956. The relevant commit is in fact https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/commit/46c1fe3bed502ff8d301cac85ff156440fbb62a3. \r\n\r\nEdit: The key wire offsets were separated from the `alct_pattern_envelope` in an additional commit. Historically, both the ALCT envelope and the offsets were contained in an array of size `CSCConstants::NUM_ALCT_PATTERNS`, which happens to be conveniently 3. However, the number ALCT patterns is independent of the pattern envelope or the key wire offsets. In fact, adding an extra ALCT pattern (for displaced muons for instance) would end up breaking the old `alct_pattern_envelope` array. \r\n\r\nEdit: `pattern2007_offset` and 'pattern2007' names were changed to `clct_pattern_offset` and `clct_pattern`. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI ran the matrix test 20434.0 successfully.\r\n\r\n@tahuang1991", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 19, "comments": 50, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1569024627", "deletions": 208, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28044, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Move CSC local trigger patterns to pattern bank", "updated_at": "1571646030", "user": "dildick"}
