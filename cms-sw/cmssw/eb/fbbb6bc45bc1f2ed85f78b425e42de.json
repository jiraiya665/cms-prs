The PR is not yet final and few other commits are expected to come but, as discussed and agreed in the last Reconstruction Meetings, we would like to at least start the review process (at least of the overall code organization) to speed up the integration.\r\n\r\nThe objects reconstructed by TICL **are not** injected into ParticleFlow by default. A customization function has been provided (`injectTICLintoPF`) in order to swap the _sim-Assisted_ reconstruction in HGCAL with the one coming from TICL.\r\nNon-optimal performances have to be expected out of the box (i.e. quite some development will have to be implemented on top of what is provided in this PR).\r\n\r\nThe final `scram build code-format` has not been run, yet: we will run it last once the PR is _final_.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe limited Matrix run w/o issues.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 36, "comments": 34, "commits": 63, "created_at": "1583244434", "deletions": 143, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-pending", "new-package-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29081, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 9, "state": "open", "title": "[HGCAL] TICL in reconstruction", "updated_at": "1584705251", "user": "rovere"}
