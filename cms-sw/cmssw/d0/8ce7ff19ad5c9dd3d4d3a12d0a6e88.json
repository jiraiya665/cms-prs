It basically change the distance calculation from x-y space to eta-phi space for the scintillator. This is motivated by the fact that the scintillator cells are uniform in eta-phi rather than x-y. The implementation has been presented in the following HGCal DPG meetings:\r\n - https://indico.cern.ch/event/827633/contributions/3463809/attachments/1861051/3058641/LC-June-12.pdf \r\n - https://indico.cern.ch/event/832849/contributions/3492963/attachments/1878032/3093327/LC-July-10.pdf\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe PR was validated locally and passes:\r\n`scram build code-checks`\r\n`scram b runtests`\r\n`runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos`\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR: No. \r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 1, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1562798016", "deletions": 96, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27485, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Layer Clustering for HGCal Scintillator", "updated_at": "1562798048", "user": "jingyucms"}
