Added a few generator fragments (e.g. TTbar, MinBias at 14TeV) with CP5 tune, intended to use for phase2 RelVal production in CMSSW release validation\r\n2. Added new generator fragments needed for phase2 RelVal production in CMSSW release validation\r\n3. Added corresponding entries for 1) and 2) in the RelVa submission macros (upgradeWorkflowComponents.py, relval_steps.py)\r\n4. MatrixInjector.py: wmsplit set to 1 for high PU RelVal submission for recent detector configurations (D35, D49 etc). It is needed to run highPU phase2 workflows smoothly in the computing system", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 31, "comments": 14, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1581509327", "deletions": 18, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-notrun", "generators-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "upgrade-pending", "urgent"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28932, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "open", "title": "Phase2 rel vals gen fragments tune cp5", "updated_at": "1581515529", "user": "siddhesh86"}
