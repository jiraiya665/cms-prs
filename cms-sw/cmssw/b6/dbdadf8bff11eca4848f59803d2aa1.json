It is necessary to ensure that all steps (DIGI, L1T, DIGI2RAW, and RAW2DIGI) are run correctly, for all the eras (Run2, Run3, Phase-2). The changes are minimal, so that the names of all producers and analyzers involved remain the same. The GEM TP producers are now put in new package `L1Trigger/L1TGEM`.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI checked that it runs with WF 11634.0 in CMSSW_11_0_X_2019-10-22-1100.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n@tahuang1991 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 15, "comments": 5, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1571913184", "deletions": 62, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-started", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28254, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Move GEM trigger primitive producers from DIGI to L1 step", "updated_at": "1571921002", "user": "dildick"}
