I changed to the TrackerTopology version in the uses that picked up SiStripDetId.h or StripSubdetector.h through TrackerTopology.h (since the latter is preferred), but added a SiStripDetId include for the few nontrivial ones (except one where the code could easily be simplified, https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/compare/master...pieterdavid:removecyclictrackercommonsistripdetid?expand=1#diff-efb246c04e3568bf8622531fd4ea48d9).\r\nThe other uses of these enums should also be changed (and use of SiStripDetId reduced in favour of TrackerTopology, where possible). I could add that here, but maybe it is better to leave that for a separate PR, after all code formatting changes have landed?\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCompiled on top of CMSSW_10_6_0 before rebasing to master (to solve a conflict with formatting changes in DQM/SiStripMonitorTrack/src/SiStripMonitorTrack.cc).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 71, "comments": 11, "commits": 637, "created_at": "1558007386", "deletions": 963, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-pending", "dqm-pending", "fastsim-pending", "geometry-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 26804, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "open", "title": "Move strip tracker partition and ModuleGeometry enums to TrackerTopology.h", "updated_at": "1558966588", "user": "pieterdavid"}
