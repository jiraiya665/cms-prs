No change is expected outside of NANOAOD content.\r\n\r\nMain updates:\r\n- Add low-pt jets to recalculate T1 MET correction (exc. uncertainties)\r\n- Updated QGL, jet ID bits\r\n- MET covariance and significance re-added\r\n- New DeepBoostedJet training (V2), more discriminators stored\r\n- Added DeepJet c-tagger\r\n- Added gain of seed crystal for energy calibration studies and systematics\r\n- New lepton MVA training for electrons and muons (using DeepJet)\r\n- Pre-calculated L1 pre-firing weights\r\n- Higgs simplified template cross sections re-added\r\n- Bugfixes: correct trigger objects for 2016, added L1 trigger bit decisions, correct tau generator-level information\r\n\r\nDepends on cms-sw/cmsdist#4937 for updated lepton MVA weights.\r\n\r\nFurther optimization (in particular, using some added content to 10_6_X MINIAOD instead of recalculating the same information) will come as a future PR, together with what depends on still-open items for the UL, and minor additions if available in time.\r\n\r\nPlease test all available NANOAOD workflows with #26672.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe base branch was tested in several releases as a part of the integration in the cms-nanoAOD repository, and in a subset of them for the branch merged with a recent IB.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 22, "comments": 8, "commits": 68, "created_at": "1557320960", "deletions": 275, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "requires-external", "tests-started", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26703, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "NanoAOD developments: 190508 version, part 1 for UL", "updated_at": "1557335024", "user": "peruzzim"}
