This adds AK4 CHS and PUPPI, both with and without jet energy correction to DQM files. This change can be seen in the DQM files under ParticleFlow/Run summary/JetResponse. Before, JetResponse will contain the histograms of 1 type of jet, but in this PR it will contain slimmedJets/JEC, slimmedJets/noJEC, slimmedJetsPuppi/JEC, and slimmedJetsPuppi/noJEC. Histograms of jets without energy correction will have \"Raw\" in the title to distinguish them from ones with jet energy correction. \r\n\r\ntest/compare.py was also changed to accommodate the folder structure changes. \r\n\r\n\r\n**PR validation:**\r\n\r\n[http://hep.baylor.edu/chosila/PFVal/plots_fixedName/test_pf.html](http://hep.baylor.edu/chosila/PFVal/plots_fixedName/test_pf.html)\r\n\r\nShows the histograms made with compare.py and the DQM files made using the modified scrips in this PR.
