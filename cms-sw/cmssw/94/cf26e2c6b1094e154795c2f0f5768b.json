Currently the ESProducer tries to read CaloGeometry, and if either CaloGeometry is not available or does not have the expected content, the ESProducer reads 3 HGCalGeometry products. With the solution in this PR, all 4 objects would get produced in the (eventual) prefetching, which is not necessarily what we want. On the other hand, (based on my understanding of the code) memory-wise this issue would only affect HGCal < V9 geometries, but I don't know how relevant those workflows still are. In addition, in principle the `phase2_hgcalV9` modifier could be used to control the behavior of this ESProducer.~~ In addition, the ESProducer is modified to use the `phase2_hgcalV9` modifier to control whether to read the CaloGeometry (for V7/V8 geometries) or 3 HGCalGeometry objects (V9 and beyond).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "comments": 18, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1560874466", "deletions": 102, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27242, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 8, "state": "open", "title": "Modernize HGCalTriggerGeometryESProducer", "updated_at": "1561007976", "user": "makortel"}
