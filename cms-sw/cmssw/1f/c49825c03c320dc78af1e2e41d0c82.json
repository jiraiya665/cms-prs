The new tool defines an updated HiggsClassification object, which contains stage 0, stage 1.1 (coarse) and stage 1.1 (fine) binning information. Note, the new tool no longer calculates the STXS stage 1 bin, and therefore analyses still at stage 1 will need to use a previous branch. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPrivately tested using microAOD production in flashgg [1]. The output microAOD file contains the new HiggsClassification object, including the 1.1. information.\r\n\r\nPasses the basic test procedure suggested in: https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html. Had to change the runtests.sh script as one of the files was no longer readable. Also, modified PhysicsTools/NanoAOD/python/particlelevel_cff.py, replacing stage 1 Higgs classification outputs with stage 1.1 (both coarse and fine binning).\r\n\r\n[1] - https://github.com/jonathon-langford/flashgg/blob/STXS_1p1/MicroAOD/test/microAODstd.py\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 0, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1557839767", "deletions": 157, "labels": [], "number": 26779, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Updating Higgs Classification for new STXS stage 1.1 binning", "updated_at": "1557839767", "user": "jonathon-langford"}
