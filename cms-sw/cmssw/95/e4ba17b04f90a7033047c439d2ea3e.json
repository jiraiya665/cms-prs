It uses the output of the new Stage1.1 HTXS classifier which was merged this morning. This filter will be used for an official MC production to produce only events in weakly populated HTXS to have enough events in these bins for legacy results in the SM H->tautau analysis.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe standard tests as well as creation of a GEN-SIM file using this new filter have been run. \r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1558530009", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "generators-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 26891, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add HTXSFilter", "updated_at": "1558530077", "user": "janekbechtel"}
