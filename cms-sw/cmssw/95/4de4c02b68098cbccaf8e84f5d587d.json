These new methods should not change the behavior of existing programs. Some error checking has been added to the `DDFilteredView` that could change the output of misbehaving programs.\r\n\r\nTracker migration to DD4hep requires some of these new utilities, so it would be helpful to merge this PR promptly.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUnit tests ran successfully. These utilities will be exercised more fully by the upcoming magnetic field geometry builder PR.\r\n\r\n#### No backport.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1563569964", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["code-checks-rejected", "comparison-pending", "geometry-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27574, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Enhancements to support the magnetic field geometry builder", "updated_at": "1563570427", "user": "cvuosalo"}
