The modelling of the dynamic gain in a particular strip hasn't changed.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested locally, performance of the algorithm in TIB and TOB is unchanged as expected (similar data-MC agreement as before), and improved description of data seen in TID and TEC layers.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 0, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1569585178", "deletions": 83, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "db-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28081, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Simulate APV dynamic gain in TID and TEC", "updated_at": "1569585211", "user": "EmyrClement"}
