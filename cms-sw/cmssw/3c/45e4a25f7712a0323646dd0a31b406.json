This PR has fixes for DDShapes classes. Conversions of angles from the degrees returned by DD4hep to the radians expected in CMS code are added. The `DDTruncTubs` class is corrected so that it returns correct values for its parameters.\r\n\r\nFor now, `DDPseudoTrap` is commented out as the need for this class is still under discussion.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis code was tested as described in #27674.\r\n\r\nNo backport is needed.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1565364547", "deletions": 17, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "geometry-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27740, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fixes for DDShapes to support DD4hep migration", "updated_at": "1565364574", "user": "cvuosalo"}
