The immediate motivation for this is to silence a clang compiler warning that was recently enabled. Also bring code into conformance with CMS code guidelines. Plus it might be useful someday.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAdded to SoATuple unit test to cover this function. Note nothing in CMSSW could be using this so it should not affect any existing code.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nNot a backport\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1567532168", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "core-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "requires-external", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27921, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Define move assignment in SoATuple.h", "updated_at": "1567532678", "user": "wddgit"}
