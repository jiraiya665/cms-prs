We decided (@rovere , @felicepantaleo , @amartelli )\r\nto follow PR #26915 and consider only CaloParticles coming from the hard scatterer, \r\nexcluding the PU contribution. Running the Timing Service on 10 events of workflow 20234.99 \r\nwe see that the timing of the hgcalValidator module is on average 3.58 s/event. \r\n\r\nWe should also note that the hgcalValidator module will for sure be even faster in cooperation \r\nwith TICL multiclusters, since at the moment the number of multiclusters produced is huge \r\n(~10^4 multiclusters per event for wf 20234.99). \r\n\r\nFurthermore, we noted a duplication of a loop coming from the git rebasing/merging, which we corrected. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nWe tested the PR with wf 20234.99 (TTbar with 200PU).\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 3, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1562770400", "deletions": 51, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27478, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[HGCal] Run HGCalValidator only on the hard scatterer event and correcting the mess from merging", "updated_at": "1562771230", "user": "apsallid"}
