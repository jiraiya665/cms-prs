Extend the SimTracker/TrackerMaterialAnalysis package to provide support for HGCal apart from Tracker.\r\n2. Every time a new HGCal geometry is produced, we calculate the dEdx weights (more info e.g [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/810242/contributions/3377477/attachments/1823243/2982972/dEdxWeightsandHitCalib_03April2018.pdf) ). The basic script that performs the calculation needs an input txt file that is produced by the SimTracker/TrackerMaterialAnalysis package.\r\n\r\nUntil now, these items were on a personal branch, however the frequent procedure of the rechit calibration every time a new version of the HGCal geometry appears, dictates that we put all code accessible by everyone and write specific instructions (will be [hgcal website](http://hgcal.web.cern.ch/hgcal/HitCalibration/hitCalibration/)).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nBoth the above tasks are done with the goal not to mess with the Tracker workflow. That's why, apart from the HGCal workflow, the Tracker one was run. No conflicts were observed. \r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nThis is not a backport.
