Inspected the xml of the payload and tested histogram sampling code in a standalone example.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 18, "comments": 3, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1567700325", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "db-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27941, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add SiStripApvSimulationParameters database object and record", "updated_at": "1567700933", "user": "pieterdavid"}
