This is not allowed by the gcc and llvm implementations of the  proposed std::experimental::propagate_const it is meant to emulate.  This PR modifies edm::propagate_const to match the behavior of the gcc and llvm implementations.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n\"checkdeps -a -A\" checked out ~95% of CMSSW, but only one violation of the stricter check was found.  The only effects of this change should be compile time errors, but nevertheless a limited matrix was run, with no unexpected errors (some workflows failed with step 1 DAS errors).\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1568462596", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["code-checks-rejected", "comparison-pending", "core-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27994, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "stronger edm::propagate_const const-correctness", "updated_at": "1568463167", "user": "dan131riley"}
