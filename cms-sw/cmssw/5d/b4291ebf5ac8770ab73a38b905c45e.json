The algorithm in it is rewritten to provide TDC timing according to the specifications of QIE11 running at p5, and the timing method is now used when simulating hcal electronics to get the TDC time\r\n2, Modification of MC Digis packing (PackerHelp.h and HCalDigiToRawuHTR.cc)\r\n    Convert the data format according to uHTR specifications for HB \r\n3, Making TDC current cut a configurable (HcalElectronicsSim.cc and some other files)\r\n    Passed a new variable to the constructor to allow for tuning of TDC current threshold from python configuration files.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n(1) pion-gun results are identical w/wo the TDC branch in 11_0_0_pre11: [results here](https://cms-cpt-software.web.cern.ch/cms-cpt-software/General/Validation/SVSuite/HCAL/calo_scan_single_pi/Run3/11_0_0_pre11_run3_TDC_vs_11_0_0_pre11_run3_SinglePi/)\r\n\r\n(2) TDC has been tested privately and yields expected results; eg. page 5 [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/856715/contributions/3606082/attachments/1929084/3194540/TDC_in_Simulation.pdf)\r\n\r\n(3) runTheMatrix.py -s test is OK.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 15, "comments": 4, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1572592442", "deletions": 124, "labels": ["code-checks-rejected", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28330, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "HCAL: implementation of TDC simulation functionality for Phase1 HB/HE", "updated_at": "1572592897", "user": "lwang046"}
