The templates have been produced for 5 different geometries in a \"temporary\" configuration that has been described in detail here [1]. The PR introduces the following changes:\r\n\r\n1.  Provide phase 2 conditions for geometries: T5, T6, T14, T15, T16 with latest DB conditions.\r\n2.  Remove phase 2 customizations forcing CPE generic method.\r\n3. Increase array sizes to allow for larger angle space of the phase 2 templates.\r\n\r\n@mmusich @tsusa @OzAmram @tvami\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with phase 2 workflows: `runTheMatrix.py --what upgrade -l 20007.0,20407.0,20807.0,21607.0,22007.0,22807.0,22834.0 -t 4 -j 8`.\r\n\r\nThe template method for pixel hit residuals has been also tested running the reconstruction step for 100K events and results will be shown here [2]. Since the templates have been produced under \"temporary\" conditions, we do not expect a big change in the resolution results obtained with this method.\r\n\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/838960/contributions/3630543/attachments/1941870/3220114/CMS_phase2tem_Nov5.pdf\r\n[2] https://indico.cern.ch/event/838961/\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nNA", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 17, "comments": 6, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1574369978", "deletions": 107, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "db-pending", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28448, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[RFC] Phase 2 tracker: template CPE", "updated_at": "1574370772", "user": "cmantill"}
