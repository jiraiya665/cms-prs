Looking at the git history showed that before the routine was returning a std::pair it returned a string and for the case in question it returned the value \"undefined\". This change now matches the earlier behavior.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested compilation under a gcc 9 IB.\r\n\r\nThis change would only cause a results change if incorrect values are being passed to the routine which was modified.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1565198691", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "db-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27717, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Added missing return statement in switch for SiStripPayloadInspectorHelper", "updated_at": "1565198719", "user": "Dr15Jones"}
