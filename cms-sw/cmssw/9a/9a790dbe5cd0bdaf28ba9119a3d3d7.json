Both the regressed energy and ID probabilities for different types of particles are the outputs of a single neural network, stored as a TensorFlow model. The first version of this model is proposed in\r\n\r\ncms-data/RecoHGCal-TICL#1.\r\n\r\nFor checking the performance with PU 200, I used workflow 20634.0. The inference takes ~0.5ms per trackster on CPU, and scales quite linearly to up to 5450 ms for ~11k tracksters (whereas this number is expected to drop once #27819 is working).\r\n\r\nThis PR is a clean version of #27634. The changes since the last review comments can be found [here](https://github.com/riga/cmssw/compare/c75d2de...e9fb179).\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "comments": 24, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1567429709", "deletions": 18, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27917, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 21, "state": "open", "title": "Add energy regression and particle identification to RecoHGCal/TICL (reopened)", "updated_at": "1568800694", "user": "riga"}
