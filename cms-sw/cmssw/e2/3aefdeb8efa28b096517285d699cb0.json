It shouldn't impact Run2 and Run3 reconstruction. Before this PR, tracks and HF clusters in |eta|=3-4 region have been heavily double-counting charged particles in this region, which will be largely remedied in this PR. This PR introduces kdtree-based linking between tracks and HF clusters.\r\n\r\nAlso, the propagator is fixed to make the track propagation to HF to work for particles with pt<3 GeV also (which was broken in the past, as it didn't matter).\r\n\r\nAlso, the HF face is updated to be in agreement with the actual geometry.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nhttp://hep.baylor.edu/hatake/PFval/PFForwardTrack/stack_offset_SinglePiPt50Eta3p45_3p54_2026D41_PU200_v0_vs_v5.pdf\r\nshows the improved offset quantities. [Horns around |eta|=3-4 much reduced with this update.]\r\n\r\nI made sure, using PF validation code, that 2018 QCD plots show no differences.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nThis is not a backport.\r\n\r\n@bendavid @jpata @iashvili\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "comments": 2, "commits": 16, "created_at": "1574308891", "deletions": 38, "labels": ["code-checks-rejected", "comparison-pending", "fastsim-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28442, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "PFlow fix/improvement in the HF region for phase2", "updated_at": "1574309440", "user": "hatakeyamak"}
