In the case of  BaseIsolator, the simplest is to atomize them, as done in this PR.\r\n\r\nThe counters here are used for printing of statistics of the ```test ``` method calls. I do not see a strong need for a correctness of this in a multithreaded environment.\r\nThe ```atomic``` is effectively to just silence the warning.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 22, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1556721265", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26586, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "atomize counters in BaseIsolator.h", "updated_at": "1556819478", "user": "slava77"}
