As expected, the blue histograms are always larger than the red ones - additional evens are recuperated. All other columns are related to multi-RP reconstruction, not affected by the bug neither this fix.\r\n\r\n![make_cmp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17830858/56913664-86cfd080-6ab2-11e9-8574-40284695beed.png)\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1556550995", "deletions": 10, "labels": [], "number": 26568, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "PPS: fix in proton reconstruction", "updated_at": "1556550995", "user": "jan-kaspar"}
