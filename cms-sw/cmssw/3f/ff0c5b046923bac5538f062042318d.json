This is expected due to the impending change of SiPM dark current modelling in MC, where placement of SOI at a later time slice allows for skipping two initial time slices at which the dark current is not well modelled (as there is not enough history).\r\n\r\nThis change is not supposed to modify any test results.\r\n\r\nThe usual \"runTheMatrix\" sequence was run to validate.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 5, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1581583060", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28948, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "More flexible SOI handling", "updated_at": "1581584241", "user": "igv4321"}
