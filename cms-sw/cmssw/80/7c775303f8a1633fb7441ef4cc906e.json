PUPPI MET is clustered based on standard PF candidates together with the value map of weights. A new boolean \"isWeighted\" is added to the reco::PFMet interface to indicate whether weights were applied during jet clustering. The packed candidates pick up the value map such that puppi does not need to be re-computed in MiniAOD.\r\n\r\nThe same was done for the puppi and PUPPI jets in #28936.\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n- Remove pfMetEI from RECO\r\n- Produce puppiForMET directly in PuppiProducer instead of a two step procedure puppiNoLep->puppiForMET and rename it to puppiNoLep, consistent with the name in PackedCandidates\r\n- Implement fillDescriptions for PFMetProducer\r\n- Rename PFMET_cfi to pfMet_cfi everywhere (for consistency with the module name)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nrunTheMatrix -l limited\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport planned.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 31, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1584716722", "deletions": 181, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29254, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "PUPPI MET in RECO", "updated_at": "1584716751", "user": "ahinzmann"}
