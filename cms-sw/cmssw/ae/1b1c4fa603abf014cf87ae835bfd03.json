This was leading to unit test crashes under clang since clang (correctly) optimized away a check for null on the address of the returned reference.\r\n\r\nAll uses of find were updated to the new interface.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe original code caused the unit test in TopQuarkAnalysis/TopEventSelection to crash in CMSSW_11_0_CLANG_X_2019-09-10-2300 when optimizations were used. With this change the unit tests run without crashing.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1568228669", "deletions": 14, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "db-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27981, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "MVAComputerContainer::find returns pointer instead of reference", "updated_at": "1568228798", "user": "Dr15Jones"}
