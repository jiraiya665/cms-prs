The DD4hep ```DDFilteredView``` is updated by adding a method ```copyNumbers``` that has the same meaning as in DDD.\r\n\r\nThe ```GeometricTimingDetAnalyzer``` has also been revisited in order to provide a detailed dump of the product of the MTDNumberingBuilder and serve for comparisons in the rewriting of this component.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe old tests run on scenario D50 without issues, and now the printout in ```MTDTopologyAnalyzer``` is fixed (previously partially not working).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "comments": 28, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1580990452", "deletions": 1468, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "geometry-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "requires-external", "tests-rejected", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28875, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "open", "title": "MTD reco geometry: preliminary cleaning", "updated_at": "1581448967", "user": "fabiocos"}
