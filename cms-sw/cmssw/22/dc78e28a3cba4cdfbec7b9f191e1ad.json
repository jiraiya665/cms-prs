Having a `void` function to call only it without checking the return value looks suspicious, especially the function has \"reset\" in its name. This PR assumes that the intention was to call `clear()` instead. According to DXR the `resetPedestals()` is not called from anywhere in CMSSW.\r\n\r\nThis issue was found by GCC 9.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code compiles without warnings with GCC 9.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1556298771", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26551, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix TT6NTPedestalCalculator::resetPedestals() to actually clear the vector", "updated_at": "1556308797", "user": "makortel"}
