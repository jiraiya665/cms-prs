On that occasion, I also fixed the production of DQMTokens: they are not really used for anything and it was fine that they were not produced correctly, but now things are closer to how the product-based DQM will look like.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/schneiml/cmssw/tree/dqm-new-dqmstore-on-CMSSW_11_0_0_pre5\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThere should be no funcitonal changes, no output changes are expected.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 214, "comments": 6, "commits": 14, "created_at": "1569920661", "deletions": 601, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "hlt-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-started", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28099, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "DQM: Restructure the edm::one DQMEDAnalyzer base classes", "updated_at": "1569932645", "user": "schneiml"}
