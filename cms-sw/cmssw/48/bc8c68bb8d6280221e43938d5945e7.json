On that occasion, I also fixed the production of DQMTokens: they are not really used for anything and it was fine that they were not produced correctly, but now things are closer to how the product-based DQM will look like.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/schneiml/cmssw/tree/dqm-new-dqmstore-on-CMSSW_11_0_0_pre5\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThere should be no functional changes, no output changes are expected.\r\nThe bin-to-bin comparison shows unexpected changes that can be explained by old bugs being fixed.
