It clusters the final LHE particles using the anti-kt jet algorithm. A cut on the minimum pT > 350 GeV is selected. This filter is a loose pre-selection of the AK8-jet pT > 650 GeV filter at particle level used in the production of TT_AK8HT650* samples. The pre-filter selects at LHE level 99.8% of the events with a jet of pT > 650 GeV at particle level, while only 3% of the inclusive ttbar sample passes the filter. Therefore, the number of events that have to be showered before the filter decision is drastically reduced.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTests have shown that this pre-filter reduces the the run time per event from ~1.3s to ~0.2s.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1566300497", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-rejected", "comparison-pending", "generators-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27809, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "renamed TopLHEFilter -> LHEJetFilter", "updated_at": "1566300892", "user": "ohindrichs"}
