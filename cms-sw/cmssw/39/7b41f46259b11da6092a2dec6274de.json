This is the third in a series of such\r\nPRs. It is possibly the last because the ones that\r\nhave not been migrated yet have been broken for years\r\nand probably are not worth the effort to migrate.\r\n\r\nThere is a considerable amount of cleanup mixed in with\r\nthis. Headers fixed, commented code removed, cout lines\r\nremoved, event counters removed, .h content moved to\r\n.cc files, destructors just defaulted, esConsumes migration\r\ndone...\r\n\r\nThe intent is nothing has been done that would change\r\nthe filter behavior and in fact the changes to the\r\nalgorithmic code in the filter methods are very small.\r\nI didn't touch any complicated logical code.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRelying on existing tests. Behavior should not change.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 36, "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1582734535", "deletions": 1527, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "generators-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29048, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Migrate 17 EDFilters in GenFilters from legacy", "updated_at": "1582816716", "user": "wddgit"}
