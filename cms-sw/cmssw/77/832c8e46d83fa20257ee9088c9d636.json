Most of the changes are machine-generated.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNo functional changes, alias seems to work.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 145, "comments": 13, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1573477808", "deletions": 161, "labels": ["alca-approved", "analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "hlt-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28375, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "DQM: Configuration alias for QualityTester", "updated_at": "1573811530", "user": "schneiml"}
