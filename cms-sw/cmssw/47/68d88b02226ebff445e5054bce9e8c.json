The runtime of DeepJet (DeepFlavour) b-tagger is reduced by ~7x, while for DeepAK8 the runtime is reduced by a few percent. \r\n\r\nTiming benchmark based on 1000 JetHT Run2017F events (running the standard NanoAOD sequence), measured on a lxplus7 node:\r\n\r\n[before]\r\n```\r\nTimeReport   0.057633     0.057633     0.057633  pfDeepFlavourJetTagsWithDeepInfo\r\nTimeReport   0.003382     0.003382     0.003382  pfDeepBoostedJetTagsAK8WithDeepInfo\r\nTimeReport   0.003456     0.003456     0.003456  pfMassDecorrelatedDeepBoostedJetTagsAK8WithDeepInfo\r\n```\r\n\r\n[after]\r\n```\r\nTimeReport   0.009149     0.009149     0.009149  pfDeepFlavourJetTagsWithDeepInfo\r\nTimeReport   0.003199     0.003199     0.003199  pfDeepBoostedJetTagsAK8WithDeepInfo\r\nTimeReport   0.003124     0.003124     0.003124  pfMassDecorrelatedDeepBoostedJetTagsAK8WithDeepInfo\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Similar speedup is also observed on an AMD CPU.)\r\n\r\nCurrently we set `MLAS_DYNAMIC_CPU_ARCH=0` (introduced in https://github.com/hqucms/onnxruntime/commit/7222aeadaa2731f858e18b555e23e464a6363645) so ONNXRuntime does not attempt to use AVX/AVX2-based kernels even if they are available on the machine. Allowing ONNXRuntime to dynamically switch to AVX/AVX2-based kernels on CPUs supporting these instructions can bring another speed-up of 1.5x ~ 2x, e.g., \r\n\r\n```\r\nMLAS_DYNAMIC_CPU_ARCH=99\r\n\r\nTimeReport   0.005881     0.005881     0.005881  pfDeepFlavourJetTagsWithDeepInfo\r\nTimeReport   0.001769     0.001769     0.001769  pfDeepBoostedJetTagsAK8WithDeepInfo\r\nTimeReport   0.001763     0.001763     0.001763  pfMassDecorrelatedDeepBoostedJetTagsAK8WithDeepInfo\r\n```\r\n\r\n(But then the results are not bitwise reproducible across different CPU architectures).\r\n\r\n#### PR Dependencies: \r\n - https://github.com/cms-sw/cmsdist/pull/5259\r\n - https://github.com/cms-data/RecoBTag-Combined/pull/25\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n - Local tests on a large file (~20k events) show changes in the DeepJet/DeepAK8 outputs only at ~ numerical precision level. \r\n - Thread-safety test: compared results from single and 4-, 8-thread runs and obtained consistent results. \r\n - No additional thread pool is created after https://github.com/hqucms/onnxruntime/commit/04f3c766dc4b0cba097ac48af9c8771beb37f3d8: `pstree` shows no additional threads being created during the job run.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 21, "comments": 12, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1570114506", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-notrun", "new-package-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "requires-external", "tests-rejected", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28112, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 19, "state": "open", "title": "ONNXRuntime-based implementation of DeepJet and DeepAK8", "updated_at": "1570197508", "user": "hqucms"}
