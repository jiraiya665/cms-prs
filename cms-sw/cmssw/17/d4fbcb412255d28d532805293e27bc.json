This involved adding the plugin FastTrackDeDxProducer.cc and modifying FastTrackerRecHits.[.h, .cc], as well as adding a data member to the class DataFormats/TrackerRecHit2D/interface/FastTrackerRecHit.h called energyLoss.\r\n\r\nThis PR was backported earlier, but closed afterwards as it was not urgently needed for production.  Now it is needed for a large SUSY signal production.  PPD has also been notified.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 3, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1569525932", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["backport-ok", "comparison-pending", "fastsim-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "number": 28076, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fastsim tracking add dedx collection - backport to 94X", "updated_at": "1569526034", "user": "ssekmen"}
