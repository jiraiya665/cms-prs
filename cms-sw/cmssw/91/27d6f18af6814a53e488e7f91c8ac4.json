The cumulative histogram BtlHitOccupancy was calculated and filled in BtlSimHitsValidation::endLuminosityBlock at step 3 and resulted not mergeable in the case of multiple parallel jobs. A new harvester module (BtlSimHitsHarvester) has been introduced and now the cumulative histogram filling is properly done at the harvesting step.\r\n\r\nIn addition, to deal with the huge number of BTL SIM/DIGI/RECO hits in the case of high PU events, the histograms with the number of hits are filled with the logarithm of the number of hits.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe updated code has been compiled in the release CMSSW_11_0_X_2019-08-21-2300 and tested with the WF 20434 and the WF 20607 with PU200.\r\n\r\nThe total size of the MTD monitoring plots is now:\r\n476.28 KiB MTD/ETL\r\n234.96 KiB MTD/BTL", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1566991872", "deletions": 42, "labels": ["code-checks-rejected", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27891, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "BTL validation update", "updated_at": "1566992331", "user": "casarsa"}
