Both the regressed energy and ID probabilities for different types of particles (e, mu, gamma, hadron) are the outputs of a single neural network, stored as a TensorFlow model. The first version of this model is proposed in\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-data/RecoHGCal-TICL/pull/1.\r\n\r\nIt does not yet produce a regressed energy, however, this PR allows the `TrackstersProducer` to be configured such that it skips the regression / ID / both. Therefore it does not require any changes in the future once the regression is included in the model.\r\n\r\nThe inference itself supports multi-threading by means of the usual splitting of TensorFlow `Graph` (stored in the global cache) and `Session` objects (one session per stream).\r\n\r\nI ran clang-format on the parts of the code I added or updated.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "comments": 34, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1564415145", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "requires-external", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27634, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 15, "state": "open", "title": "Add energy regression and particle identification to RecoHGCal/TICL.", "updated_at": "1565675838", "user": "riga"}
