Since the new HDQM\r\nmanaged by the DQM group since more than a year lives outside CMSSW,\r\nand Tracker HDQM did for a long time before, I assume this is unused.\r\n\r\nI can't tell if anybody is using maybe some of the funcitonality in that\r\npackage, but removing it is probably the best way to find out.\r\n\r\nThe `SiStripHistoricInfoClient` was removed as it depends on `DQMServices/Diagnostic` but does not add much in terms of functionality in its main functionality. There is a large amount of code in `test/` in that package, but if it is all related to this historic DQM it is probably no longer needed either.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nNone; assuming package is unused.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 108, "comments": 15, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1572279839", "deletions": 11495, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-notrun", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28297, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "DQM: Remove DQMServices/Diagnostic", "updated_at": "1572452517", "user": "schneiml"}
