Remove unused plugins in EgammaHLTProducers\r\n 2. Merge the .h and .cc files of the remaining plugins and put them into the plugin directory\r\n 3. Remove the RecoEgamma/EgammaHLTAlgos package since only two classes in that package are still used at this point:\r\n    * *EgammaHLTPixelMatchElectronAlgo*: only used in EgammaHLTProducers/plugins anyway so it should just go there\r\n    *  *EgammaHLTTrackIsolation*: used not only in EgammaHLTProducers but also in DQMOffline/Trigger. As an isolation algo, it was moved to RecoEgamma/EgammaIsolationAlgos since both packages that use EgammaHLTTrackIsolation already depend on the EgammaIsolationAlgos package anyway.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles and local matrix tests run.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 96, "comments": 22, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1567248466", "deletions": 7061, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "core-pending", "dqm-pending", "hlt-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27909, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "open", "title": "Cleanup of EgammaHLTAlgos/Producers", "updated_at": "1567494450", "user": "guitargeek"}
