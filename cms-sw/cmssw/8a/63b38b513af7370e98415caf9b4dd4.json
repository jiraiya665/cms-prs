It is based on #28379, which includes the changes that make this PR possible] Edit: rebased after these PRs are merged.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the `DQMServices/ClientConfig` package. The more important parts of its functionality (`DQMGenericClient`, `QualityTester`) where moved to `DQMServices/Components` in #28379. What remains is `DQMParserBase`, some sort of XML parsing helper based on Xerces, and a few more random files.\r\n\r\nThe few modules that where using `DQMParserBase` (`SiPixelMonitorClient`/`SiStripMonitorClient`/`SiStripCommissioningClients`) now have their parsers stubbed out. The only one of them used in the (short matrix) tests seems to be one part of `SiPixelMonitorClient`, which has been replaced with a `boost::property_tree` based parser. I also implemented a parser for `SiStripMonitorClient`, but could not actually test it yet (it may be used in online DQM, which I can test at some point). The others remain stubbed out, and while I could easily replace them, I am hesitant to do so without being able to test them at all.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone for this PR, but some in #28316. No changes in PR tests expected, but most of the affected code is not covered by the PR tests. The stubbed out implementations clearly won't work, but it is questionable if they are still used anywhere. The assertions should make sure that anything using the missing functionality crashes.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 35, "comments": 31, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1573562628", "deletions": 1247, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28380, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "DQM: Remove ClientConfig package", "updated_at": "1580220012", "user": "schneiml"}
