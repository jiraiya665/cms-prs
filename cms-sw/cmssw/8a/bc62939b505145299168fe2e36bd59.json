With this PR, the calculated sum of the pTs of the unclustered particles is stored, and can be accessed with metSumPt(), similar to metSignificance().\r\nThis makes a later calculation, e.g. in nanoAOD as proposed in [this PR](https://github.com/cms-nanoAOD/cmssw/pull/443), redundant.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAll tests have been run, and were passed.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1573295716", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28370, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Keeping sumPt from MET Significance calculation", "updated_at": "1573295748", "user": "danbarto"}
