PUPPI jets are clustered based on standard PF candidates together with the value map of weights. The packed candidates pick up this value map such that puppi does not need to be re-computed in MiniAOD.\r\n\r\nThe same can be done for the puppiNoLep and PUPPI MET in a separate PR (to keep this one as slim as possible).\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n- Removing AK8CHS from RECO\r\n- Removing CMSTopTagger from RECO\r\n- slimmedJetsPuppi: Removing puppi multiplictiy user floats and store the directly in jet specifics rounded to integers (this is enough for jet ID purposes anyways).\r\n- slimmedJetsAK8: Remove all user float related to AK8CHS\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nrunTheMatrix -l limited\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport planned.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 46, "comments": 73, "commits": 31, "created_at": "1581532120", "deletions": 513, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28936, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "open", "title": "PUPPI jets in RECO", "updated_at": "1583258427", "user": "ahinzmann"}
