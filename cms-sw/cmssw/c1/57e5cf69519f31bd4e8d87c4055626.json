This fix tries to check if the 0T override has been set and only turns on CR if it has not. Their may be a cleaner way to do this, so we are open to suggestions. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe expect this PR to produce no changes except for 0T data. \r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI have tested that several runTheMatrix workflows still run as expected and now 0T data works as well. \r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 5, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1558722387", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 26940, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Turn off Cluster Repair for 0T data", "updated_at": "1558723340", "user": "OzAmram"}
