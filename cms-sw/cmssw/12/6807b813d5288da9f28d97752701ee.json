If I saw something that looked bad\r\nin the vicinity of the shadowing fixes.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis relies on existing tests. Nothing should change in the externally\r\nvisible behavior of the code.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 45, "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1568837638", "deletions": 1195, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28022, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix GCC 9 shadowing compiler warnings in Core (2nd try)", "updated_at": "1568871216", "user": "wddgit"}
