While PR #28804 did fix workflow 136.891, it broke workflows 136.8642,136.8643,136.886,136.8861,136.8862,136.888,136.889,136.89,136.893,136.895,136.896 and 137.8.\r\n\r\nThese workflows currently use \"prompt-like\" GTs, which are similar to the prompt GTs that were used for prompt reconstruction of the Run2018 datasets. Now that an offline GT is available for Run 2018D, a prompt-like GT is no longer needed. The errors in the failing workflows are resolved after switching to the offline GTs. The key `auto:run2_data_promptlike_hi` is kept because there is no offline GT for the Run II HI data.\r\n\r\nAttn: @mmusich @silviodonato \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe PR was tested with `addOnTests.py -j 8` and `runTheMatrix.py -l 136.8642,136.8643,136.886,136.8861,136.8862,136.888,136.889,136.89,136.893,136.895,136.896,137.8,136.891 --ibeos`.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1580336073", "deletions": 40, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "hlt-approved", "orp-pending", "pdmv-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28825, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Convert workflows that use pp prompt-like GTs to use offline GTs", "updated_at": "1580386900", "user": "christopheralanwest"}
