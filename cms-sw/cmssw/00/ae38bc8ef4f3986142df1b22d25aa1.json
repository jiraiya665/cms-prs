The result is that the usual interactions with the ME are now locked and thread-safe, similar to the `ConcurrentMonitorElement`. This means we can now drop the `ConcurrentMonitorElement` and instead use `MonitorElement const*`. Of course there are still plenty of non-thread-safe interactions in the `MonitorElement`, but these should all be non-const.\r\n\r\nFor now, this is incomplete, and only to run some partial tests.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/schneiml/cmssw/blob/dqm-new-dqmstore-on-CMSSW_11_0_0_pre5/DQMServices/Core/src/MonitorElement.cc\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nIn progress.
