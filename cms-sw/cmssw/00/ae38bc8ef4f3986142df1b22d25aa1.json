The result is that the usual interactions with the ME are now locked and thread-safe, similar to the `ConcurrentMonitorElement`. This means we can now drop the `ConcurrentMonitorElement` and instead use `MonitorElement*`. Of course there are still plenty of non-thread-safe interactions in the `MonitorElement`, but these should not be used.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/schneiml/cmssw/blob/dqm-new-dqmstore-on-CMSSW_11_0_0_pre5/DQMServices/Core/src/MonitorElement.cc\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nNo output changes expected, and none observed.\r\nHowever, some of the tests where probably incorrect -- the code was almost certainly uncompilable yet passed the tests.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 60, "comments": 166, "commits": 16, "created_at": "1569838807", "deletions": 2266, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "dqm-pending", "hlt-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28092, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 12, "state": "open", "title": "DQM: Merge MonitorElement and ConcurrentMonitorElement", "updated_at": "1572516344", "user": "schneiml"}
