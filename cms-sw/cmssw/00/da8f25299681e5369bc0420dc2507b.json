Code has been migrated as-is with very minimal changes. The existing code could be rewritten and revised, but that task is not within the scope of this PR. The principles of this PR:\r\n* Continue to support the old DD, along with the new DD4hep\r\n* Keep changes to old code to the bare minimum\r\n* Share as much code between the old and new DD methods as possible\r\n\r\nNote that we think that the pseudo-trapezoid shape will no longer need to be built with DD4hep, but this PR keeps pseudo-trapezoid code for now until a final decision about eliminating it is made later.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes fixes to the new DDShapes that may be needed by other developers.\r\n\r\nThis PR should not change the behavior of current workflows.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nA unit test is included in this PR, and it thoroughly tests the geometry builder. This test was run for the old DD and the new DD4hep version, and the results were the same. Other units tests and matrix tests were also successful.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 45, "comments": 14, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1564689136", "deletions": 908, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "geometry-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27674, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Magnetic field geometry builder migration to DD4hep", "updated_at": "1564772973", "user": "cvuosalo"}
