This PR also addresses a question that was asked a while ago [here](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/25685#issuecomment-458535838). \r\n\r\nI did rename the configuration from `me0TriggerPseudoDigis_cfi` to `me0TriggerConvertedPseudoDigis_cfi`, otherwise `me0TriggerPseudoDigis_cfi` would clash with modules defined in `me0TriggerPseudoDigis_cff`. (The new objects are in fact converted ME0Segments.) I also added the standard `me0RecHits` and `me0Segments` modules in the sequence so that `me0TriggerConvertedPseudoDigis` has all the required inputs.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI ran matrix test 20434.0 to check that the triggers are produced and saved in the event content. That is indeed the case as you can see below. The new `Converted` pseudo digis are of type `ME0TriggerDigi` in contrast to `me0TriggerPseudoDigis` which is of type `ME0Segment`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n-bash-4.2$ edmEventSize -a -v step2.root | grep me0Trigger\r\nME0DetIdME0SegmentsOwnedRangeMap_me0TriggerPseudoDigis__HLT. 1299 666\r\nME0DetIdME0TriggerDigiMuonDigiCollection_me0TriggerConvertedPseudoDigis__HLT. 495.6 328.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nFYI: @tahuang1991 @mmaggi", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 1, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1571170352", "deletions": 30, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28183, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Enable ME0TriggerPseudoDigiProducer in Phase-2 L1T sequence", "updated_at": "1571170384", "user": "dildick"}
