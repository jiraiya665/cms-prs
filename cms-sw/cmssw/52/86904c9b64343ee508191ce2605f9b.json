Since I have no idea of whether this is OK, I left it as it is, and I maintained this difference of conventions in the TCDS portion of the code.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nPietro", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 15, "comments": 36, "commits": 18, "created_at": "1583424180", "deletions": 47, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29116, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 44, "state": "open", "title": "Strips Offline code: TCDS-Scal migration ", "updated_at": "1583764555", "user": "vischia"}
