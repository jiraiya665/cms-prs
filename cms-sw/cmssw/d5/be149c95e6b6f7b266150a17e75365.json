The code is still in an early development phase, but this version has been used to prepare the L1T TDR results and it is stable enough to be used by other experts. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code has been extensively validated (and already integrated) in the  L1T integration branch linked https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideL1TPhase2Instructions\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 58, "comments": 44, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1581585969", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28950, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "DT TPG for Phase-2 L1T upgrade", "updated_at": "1584625149", "user": "folguera"}
