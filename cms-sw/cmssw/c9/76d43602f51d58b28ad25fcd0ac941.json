At the same time the old ```FastTimerSD``` class, used in the very first simulation of MTD (no more available) is removed, and the corresponding production cuts and sensitive volume definitions in ```Geometry/HGCalSimData``` are deleted.\r\n\r\nThe residual dependency of ```SimG4CMS/Forward``` on DDD is concentrated in Zdc. But as far as I can see the ```ZdcShowerLibrary``` doe not really use the ```DDCompactView```  passed through the constructor, so this dependency does not look real and could be removed: @bsunanda @civanch do you agree?\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTest wf 23234.0 (scenario D49) step 1 runs smoothly providing the identical same set of Sim and Calo hits, as shown by https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/SimG4Core/Application/test/runSimHitCaloHitDumper_cfg.py", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1584348596", "deletions": 223, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "geometry-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29213, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "MTD Sensitive Detector: make it independent on DDD", "updated_at": "1584354249", "user": "fabiocos"}
