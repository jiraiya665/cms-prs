With PFElectron- and PFPhotonAlgo gone, there are not other algos to share the calibrations with anyway\r\n* therefore I got rid of all usages of shared_ptr in RecoParticleFlow/PFProducer\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles and matrix tests pass.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "comments": 1, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1560148391", "deletions": 649, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27154, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Avoid shared_ptr in RecoParticleFlow/PFProducer and remove PFSCEnergyCalibration", "updated_at": "1560148414", "user": "guitargeek"}
