These member functions were originally kept for backwards compatibility with the old `ElectronSeed` class so the new `ElectronSeed` could be quickly integrated without adapting function calls in all of CMSSW. in Probably it's now a good time for removing them in this purely pattern replacing PR.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1571308812", "deletions": 121, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "hlt-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28198, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Clean redundant member functions from ElectronSeed", "updated_at": "1571308869", "user": "guitargeek"}
