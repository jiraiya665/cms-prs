The need to 1) add the new ETL design and 2) to migrate this code to DD4hep strengthen the need for a code simplification and refresh, already emerged in the 2018 review and in more recent discussions with @ianna.\r\n\r\nThis PR is the first step in this direction: the aim is to preserve the existing geometry description, to be tested in detail through the refreshed test classes in ```Geometry/MTDNumberingBuilder``` and ```Geometry/MTDGeometryBuilder```, while moving from a layered build of the ```GeometricTimingDet``` structure from DDD to a much simpler overall loop, where only the subdetectors (BTL and ETL, two sides) and the final sensitive modules are kept (and appear necessary).\r\nSeveral intermediate classes are removed, with no apparent impact on the final geometry structure produced in ```MTDGeometryBuilder```. \r\n\r\nThe following step is the modification of the ```DDDCmsMTDConstruction``` class (and auxiliary code) to include the new geometry structure of ETL as implemented by @icosivi at xml level.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe dumps of the geometries, provided the same version of the test analyzers in ```mtd_cfg.py``` for the benchmark scenario D50, differ only  in ```GeometricTimingDetAnalyzer``` for the fix of the type of modules performed in GeometricTimingDet (but apparently not relevant in the final construction of the geometry):\r\n\r\n```\r\n173c100\r\n< Module = BModule33Layer1NegativeZTimingwafer type = 4 rawId = 1652669440 Sub/side/RR = 1 0 1\r\n---\r\n> Module = BModule33Layer1NegativeZTimingwafer type = 100 rawId = 1652669440 Sub/side/RR = 1 0 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n79638c72655\r\n< Module = EModule1Disc1Timingwafer type = 10 rawId = 1665204352 Sub/side/RR = 2 1 1\r\n---\r\n> Module = EModule1Disc1Timingwafer type = 100 rawId = 1665204352 Sub/side/RR = 2 1 1\r\n```\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 28, "comments": 29, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1582118182", "deletions": 856, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "geometry-pending", "hold", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28997, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "open", "title": "MTD RECO geometry: MTDNumberingBuilder code simplification", "updated_at": "1582367019", "user": "fabiocos"}
