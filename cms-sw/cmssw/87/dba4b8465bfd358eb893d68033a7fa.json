They either could not run or they encountered serious errors or exceptions while running. These scripts are intended to be occasionally used by experts to perform validations. They are not used in production.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this PR is to enable these scripts to run to completion without encountering major exceptions. The idea is that something is better than nothing. However, this PR does not ensure that these scripts are performing complete and fully correct validation. A follow-up PR by an expert with more time and expertise will be required to update and correct all these validations for current scenarios.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe scripts actually run to completion without major problems. Some potentially useful geometry validation is performed.\r\n\r\nNo backport is needed.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "comments": 11, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1583517396", "deletions": 71, "labels": ["bug-fix", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "db-pending", "dqm-pending", "geometry-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29138, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Enable rarely used geometry scripts to run to completion", "updated_at": "1583521778", "user": "cvuosalo"}
