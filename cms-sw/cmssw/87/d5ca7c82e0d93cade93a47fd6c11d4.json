These classes are incompatible with new Geant4 10.6, because original authors overwrite too many virtual methods of classes. Only public methods of Geant4 classes are stable between versions 10.0 and 10.6, private and protected method signatures potentially may be changed. \r\n\r\nThis PR includes general clean-up, which means removal all unnecessary things. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 11, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1580236123", "deletions": 1184, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28814, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Clean-up SIMP particles simulation", "updated_at": "1580286644", "user": "civanch"}
