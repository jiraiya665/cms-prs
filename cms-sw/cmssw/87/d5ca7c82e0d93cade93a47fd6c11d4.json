These classes are incompatible with new Geant4 10.6, because original authors overwrite too many virtual methods of classes. This broke  GEANT4 IB (https://cmssdt.cern.ch/SDT/cgi-bin/buildlogs/slc7_amd64_gcc820/CMSSW_11_1_GEANT4_X_2020-01-27-1100/SimG4Core/CustomPhysics). The reason: only public methods of Geant4 classes are stable between versions 10.0 and 10.6, private and protected method signatures potentially may be changed. \r\n\r\nThis PR includes general clean-up, which means removal all unnecessary things. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 13, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1580236123", "deletions": 1184, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28814, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Clean-up SIMP particles simulation", "updated_at": "1580286874", "user": "civanch"}
