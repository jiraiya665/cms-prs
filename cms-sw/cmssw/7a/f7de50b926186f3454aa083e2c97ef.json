This is to optimize PUPPI with phase-1 tracking. The performance was discussed here:\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/876142/#5-update-on-puppi-tuning\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the necessary switches without changing the current behavior of the algorithm, i.e. no changes to RECO+MiniAOD are expected from this PR.\r\n\r\nPR validation:\r\n\r\nruntests\r\n\r\nBackports\r\n\r\nWe would like to have these options backported to 10_6_X, to introduce a new PUPPI configuration for UL MiniAOD-v2 and for JMEcustomNanoAODs as soon as the PR is merged.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1579000783", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28735, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add parameter for treatment of charged high eta in PUPPI", "updated_at": "1579005167", "user": "ahinzmann"}
