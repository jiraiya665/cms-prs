Due to the different sources, the structure is not perfect, but I think it covers all important aspects and, most importantly, matches the current implementation.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nNo code is affected. I did proof-read it once.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 8, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1583940727", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29184, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "DQM: Add README for DQMServices/Core.", "updated_at": "1584010258", "user": "schneiml"}
