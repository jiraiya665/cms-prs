This is tracked to:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/fb7c976b0bd6784c61295852158c36675939be56/CommonTools/PileupAlgos/plugins/PuppiProducer.cc#L275-L291\r\n\r\non L281 and L283, `iPuppiMatched` should not be used to access the puppi weight from `lWeights`, as `lWeights` is 1-to-1 with `hPFProduct` -- instead `val` is the correct index. \r\n\r\nAs this only affects the puppi weights set for the new packedCandidates, this discrepancy does not affect cases when `useExistingWeights=True`, or running on RECO/AOD inputs.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this discrepancy and also simplifies the logic to compute the Puppi-scaled p4.\r\n\r\n@ahinzmann ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1568958747", "deletions": 51, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28033, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix a discrepancy in Puppi weights when running on MiniAOD w/ useExistingWeights=False", "updated_at": "1569451296", "user": "hqucms"}
