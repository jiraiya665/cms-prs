This is to have the latest tau discriminator versions ready for a coming integration of tau ID versions into global tag.\r\nThe NanoAOD config is updated such that 2018 version is taken from PAT taus and the old 2015 version is recalculated. For already existing input samples from former productions a switch is introduced to do it the other way round (as it was before this PR).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nReco and PAT step were run on a test set and output compared to corresponding NanoAOD sample that already contains both versions of AntiEleDiscriminator. NanoAOD step was also run on a test set with different config eras and output checked.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 20, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1562678738", "deletions": 255, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-started", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27465, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 15, "state": "open", "title": "Update tau anti electron discriminators in RECO and MiniAOD", "updated_at": "1563271711", "user": "swozniewski"}
