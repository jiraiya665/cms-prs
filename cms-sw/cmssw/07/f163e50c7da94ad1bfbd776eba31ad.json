It was also used in the ElectronIDValueMapProducer, which can now be removed that all the variables are in the object. I also think I made a mistake introducing the MultiToken to begin with. The consumes should be better configured with Python... That makes the MVAValueMapProducer also a bit simpler to use as it's not ambiguous anymore how it can be configured.\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n* adapted Electron MVA FWLite python code and test (thanks to the appropriate relvals being available now)\r\n* merge header and source of some plugins in Electron-PhotonIdentification\r\n* put all the plugin template definitions in Electron-PhotonIdentification into plugins.cc file\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles and local matrix tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n \r\nMaybe the FWLite part should get backported to 10_6_X.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 33, "comments": 51, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1558037324", "deletions": 842, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "xpog-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 26814, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "open", "title": "Adapting MVAVariableHelper to new E/gamma UL format and removal of MultiToken", "updated_at": "1560496606", "user": "guitargeek"}
