This pattern is repeated for all the plugins. I would suggest to simplify this by having the plugins all inherit from `EcalClusterFunctionBaseClass` directly. Like this, the `RecoEcal/EgammaCoreTools/plugins` directory looks radically simpler and it would really help for understanding the code and future refactors. For example, one can now just do `git grep EcalClusterFunctionBaseClass` to find all the plugins that inherit from it. This PR doesn't make any actual changes to the code, it just reshuffles some lines.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW complies and local matrix tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 32, "comments": 3, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1572617920", "deletions": 741, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28332, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Simplify inheritance hirachy of EcalClusterFunctions", "updated_at": "1572618609", "user": "guitargeek"}
