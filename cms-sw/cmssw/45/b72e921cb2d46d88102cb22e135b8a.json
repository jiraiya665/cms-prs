Can now choose to seed in the (default) r-phi space or x-y space\r\n- Optimization of the cluster shape variables used for cluster identification\r\n- Add framework for cluster energy interpretations and implement the EM interpretation\r\n- Update trigger geometry and Concentrator to deal with a \"decentralized\" concentrator architecture\r\n- Add energy compression for SuperTriggerCells\r\n- Add combinations of concentrator algorithms\r\n\r\nDepends on external https://github.com/cms-data/L1Trigger-L1THGCal/pull/16\r\n\r\nRight after this PR is merged, an other one will follow which integrates the HFNose into the HGCAL TPG.\r\n(FYI @mariadalfonso)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nStandard code checks and formatting.\r\n```\r\nscram b code-checks\r\nscram b code-format\r\n```\r\nTest V9, V10, V11 workflows (though the HGCAL trigger is still disconnected for V11).\r\n```\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -w upgrade -l 20034.0 --maxSteps=2\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -w upgrade -l 20434.0 --maxSteps=2\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -w upgrade -l 22034.0 --maxSteps=2\r\n```\r\nAdditionally each of these commits have been validated by looking at their impact on standard object distributions, and have also been validated with performance studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 52, "comments": 20, "commits": 17, "created_at": "1573577491", "deletions": 588, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "requires-external", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28385, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 14, "state": "open", "title": "[HGCAL trigger] Mainly seeding and frontend Concentrator updates ", "updated_at": "1573770448", "user": "jbsauvan"}
