This fix was pending for long and now a good time to implement.\r\n2) FTFP_BERT_EMY physics list provide crashes in CMS geometry, which were recently understood and more safe parameters for Geant4 tracking are proposed\r\n3) Custom physics configuration historically have parameters , which are not used, so they are removed\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nprivate\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1574089426", "deletions": 17, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28416, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Clean-up Geant4 Physics Lists", "updated_at": "1574089454", "user": "civanch"}
