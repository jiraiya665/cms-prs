I identified several conditional branches(if statements) and replaced them with boolean variables in order to limit the number of branching. This helps compiler to autovectorize the code to gain potential speedup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI used workflow number 21234.0_TTbar_14TeV+TTbar_14TeV_TuneCUETP8M1_2026D44_GenSimHLBeamSpotFull14+DigiFullTrigger_2026D44+RecoFullGlobal_2026D44+HARVESTFullGlobal_2026D44\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 50, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1568215584", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27980, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 18, "state": "open", "title": "Reduced radom number calls in the runSimple Method of HGCDigitizerBase for Potential Speedup.", "updated_at": "1568913642", "user": "adas1994"}
