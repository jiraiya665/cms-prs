However, a bit part of the duplicate code serves to compute cluster energy corrections, so I could move this into the PFEnergyCalibration class which is used by both algos. I think this is a good step to avoid this code duplication, but I don't want to go further for now to not risk accidentally changing the logic. What do you think?\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles and matrix tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 35, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1581640157", "deletions": 294, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28960, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "open", "title": "Slightly refactor PF endcap cluster calibration", "updated_at": "1583417904", "user": "guitargeek"}
