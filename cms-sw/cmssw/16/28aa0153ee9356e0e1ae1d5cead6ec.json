This PR includes all the packages in the FWCore subsystem not previously formatted, except the Skeletons package.\r\n\r\nThere were a few addition changes that showed up in code-checks in the second commit.\r\n\r\nI also manually added one fix in the third commit to disambiguate the name of a preprocessor macro. Previously the compiler did not complain because the definitions in FWCore and Fireworks were identical, but the spacing change introduced by clang format caused the compiler to start issuing warnings.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe only test I performed was checking that the revised packages compile and build.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 555, "comments": 3, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1556893994", "deletions": 33401, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "core-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26617, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Changes from scram build format-all on FWCore", "updated_at": "1556894539", "user": "wddgit"}
