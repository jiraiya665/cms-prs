It should be merged with #27203.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTrivial backport of #27089, which is already merged in master. I tried running `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos` but it repeated failed due to DAS errors, despite having a valid grid proxy. Since I don't expect any failures, I may as well run the tests here.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of #27089. It should be merged simultaneously with #27203.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 9, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1560433410", "deletions": 25, "labels": ["alca-approved", "backport-ok", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "requires-external", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 27205, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Update global tags to include new EGamma regression [10_6_X]", "updated_at": "1560452235", "user": "christopheralanwest"}
