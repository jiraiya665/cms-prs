It should not affect any offline processing. Main changes include:\r\n\r\n   * TriggerKey is now generated together with LUTs (as opposed to by a separate online tool)\r\n   * adding typinfo element to both LUT and TriggerKey content to support new online xmldb format. \r\n   * add input information for LUT generation to TriggerKey content which will be used by O2O for automatic synchronization of online LUTs and corresponding offline conditions updates\r\n   * plus some minor fixes and improvements (input parameters are defined in input card, fix/update  for crate to subdet id function etc. )\r\n\r\n \r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThe code has been used to generate past and upcoming online LUTs and trigger keys. \r\nThe PR should not affect any offline workflow. \r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 19, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1581501550", "deletions": 85, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-pending", "l1-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28930, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 8, "state": "open", "title": "Updates for HCAL online TPG LUT and Trigger keys", "updated_at": "1581926848", "user": "ak427"}
