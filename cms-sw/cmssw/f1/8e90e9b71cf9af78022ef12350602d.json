The variables are not stored in MiniAODs so they need to be re-calculated again by scheduling pileupJetIdCalculator. Then, the variables need to be stored in ValueMaps and this is done by scheduling PileupJetIDVarProducer plugin which will be added also. The rest is just normal procedure to save variables in NanoAODs. At the moment, these variables are set to be calculated and stored only for AK4PFCHS jets.\r\n\r\n**if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:**\r\n\r\nOriginal PR is #28430\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 2, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1575991352", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 28599, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Backport of #28430 (Add variables for PileUp Jet ID BDT in JME Custom-NanoAODs)", "updated_at": "1576002218", "user": "nurfikri89"}
