Logic is modified in `SiStripDCSStatus` and `DetStatus`. \r\nBoth classes are used to select events in different ALCARECO workflows, while `SiStripDCSStatus`\r\nis also used to filter events in several Tracker and Tracking DQM modules.\r\nNo differences are expected in Run1 and Run2 workflows. For Run3 data the ALCARECO selectors now work correctly.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with `runTheMatrix.py -l 1001.0,138.1` and checked that in runs with SCAL there are no differences, while with recent MWGR 2020 cosmic data the events are filtered correctly.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport, but a backport will be proposed in 11.0.X to be used for the next MWGR.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 1, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1584107664", "deletions": 49, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29198, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Allow to take DCS Status from software FED, when SCAL is not available", "updated_at": "1584107709", "user": "mmusich"}
