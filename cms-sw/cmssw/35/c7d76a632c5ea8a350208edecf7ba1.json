The new bit manipulation gives the same results (as tested in the unit test) but avoids the undefined behavior.\r\n\r\nThis was found by UBSAN.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code compiles and the new unit test succeeds. The unit test also shows that the UBSAN error goes away.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1563566182", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27572, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Avoid unrepresentable int value in BitSet", "updated_at": "1563566723", "user": "Dr15Jones"}
