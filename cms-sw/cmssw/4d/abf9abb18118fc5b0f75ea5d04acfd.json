This code is ported from https://github.com/hls-fpga-machine-learning/SonicCMS. Unit tests are included (based on the Acquire tests for ExternalWork in `FWCore/Integration/test`).\r\n\r\nDocumentation is provided in the package README, as well as in a [presentation](https://indico.cern.ch/event/892069/) at the core software meeting.\r\n\r\nThis package will be supplemented by additional packages implementing concrete clients for different communication protocols as the needed externals become available. (A separate package for each communication protocol is foreseen in order to compartmentalize the different external dependencies.)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUnit tests run successfully.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "comments": 2, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1583528910", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-rejected", "comparison-pending", "new-package-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29141, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Introduce SONIC core in CMSSW", "updated_at": "1583529251", "user": "kpedro88"}
