To run a real test is required to make a repository to store the BDT xml file (now residing under RecoMTD/TimingIDTools/data). Please create a cms-data repository for this package.\r\n\r\n@parbol @hatakeyamak @bendavid @simonepigazzini", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 16, "comments": 91, "commits": 28, "created_at": "1580236809", "deletions": 184, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "requires-external", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending", "urgent"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28815, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 44, "state": "open", "title": "MTD TDR Reconstruction + MTD Track Association BDT ", "updated_at": "1581433935", "user": "pmeridian"}
