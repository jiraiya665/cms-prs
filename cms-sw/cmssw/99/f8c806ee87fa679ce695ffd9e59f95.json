To run a real test is required to make a repository to store the BDT xml file (now residing under RecoMTD/TimingIDTools/data). Please create a cms-data repository for this package.\r\n\r\n@parbol @hatakeyamak @bendavid @simonepigazzini", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 16, "comments": 3, "commits": 20, "created_at": "1580236809", "deletions": 145, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "new-package-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28815, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Reopening of PR #28279: MTD TDR Reconstruction + MTD Track Association BDT ", "updated_at": "1580237689", "user": "pmeridian"}
