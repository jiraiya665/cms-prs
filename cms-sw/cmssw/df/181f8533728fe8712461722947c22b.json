This has been observed to occupy resources on the build servers.  This PR calls `TProof::Close(\"S\")`, which should tell the workers to shutdown rather than detach.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan the standard tests and observed that no worker processes were left behind.  This PR should have no impact on anything outside the scope of the TFWLiteSelector unit tests.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1572364546", "deletions": 0, "labels": [], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28305, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "call close with the option to shutdown workers", "updated_at": "1572364578", "user": "dan131riley"}
