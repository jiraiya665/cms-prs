The  ```G4GlauberGribovCrossSection``` class, no more present in Geant4, has been replaced by the available ```G4ComponentGGHadronNucleusXsc```. Include files have been moved to ```interface```, the ```G4``` names have been turned into ```CMS``` as done for many other models, and include guards have been updated according to the standard we adopt.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles and passes ```scram b code-checks```, but no dedicated test workflow is provided to probe the real code behaviour in the original proposal. @civanch should confirm the correctness of the adopted approach, and possible tests to be performed.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 21, "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1579529094", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28763, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "open", "title": "Forward port of Geant4 SIMP custom physics model to master branch ", "updated_at": "1579617784", "user": "fabiocos"}
