One thing I'd like to address is the inheritance of plugins from \"BaseProducers\", which is something that I think sometimes awkwardly lies between plugin configuration and separate plugins. The `GsfElectronCoreBaseProducer` is one of these instances where it's probably not good to do it: the base producer just manages three products which are not even used by all inheriting producers and has a two-liner member function. Repeating this code in the inheriting producers is actually less verbose than having the base class, while making it clear which products are actually used and also making the transition to global modules easier.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I apply several modernizations to the ElectronCore producers like the usage of `edm::EDGetTokenT` and also gave a similar treatment to the `GEDGsfElectronFinalizer` while at it.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles and local matrix tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "comments": 1, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1579122215", "deletions": 401, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28746, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "No need for GsfElectronCoreBaseProducer", "updated_at": "1579122257", "user": "guitargeek"}
