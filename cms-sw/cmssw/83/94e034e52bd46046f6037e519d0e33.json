With this PR, the calculated sum of the pTs of the unclustered particles is stored, and can be accessed with metSumPtUnclustered(), similar to metSignificance().\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAll tests have been run, and were passed.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nbackport of #28370, needed for nanoAODv7\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "changed_files": 9, "comments": 8, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1584988979", "deletions": 24, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 29276, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 11, "state": "open", "title": "keeping MET sumPtUnclustered (backport of #28370)", "updated_at": "1585061628", "user": "danbarto"}
