In the past, we rely on a postfix string to distinguish whether the AK8 jets have puppi scaled daughters or not, which is quite fragile. Now we unifies it to always first get the original candidate (via the `key()`, inspired by @raggleton's [RekeyJets](https://github.com/UHH2/UHH2/blob/RunII_102X_v1/core/plugins/RekeyJets.cc)) and then scaled it by the puppi weight. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested in a boosted TT sample and no change in the discriminator outputs found.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1568963169", "deletions": 38, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28035, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Simplify jet daughter processing in DeepBoostedJet", "updated_at": "1568964216", "user": "hqucms"}
