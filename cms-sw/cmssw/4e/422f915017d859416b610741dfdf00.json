As the original code is laid out quite clearly, simply in a long stream of consciousness, it is easy to factorize for example the part processing photons into a separate function. In a future iteration, we can factorize also the rest of the `processBlock` function.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nWe do not change the functionality of the PFAlgo code, we have validated by re-running the RECO sequence on 10k events and observed exactly the same PF reconstruction output. The full test matrix is running, I will report back with the output, I expect no new failures.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nThis is a partial port of the original proposal PR in https://github.com/jpata/cmssw/pull/44\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1558104520", "deletions": 29, "labels": [], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 26825, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "refactor PFAlgo::processblock usePFPhotons part", "updated_at": "1558104553", "user": "jpata"}
