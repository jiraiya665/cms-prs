The photon pt cut, photon eta cut, isolation cone size, and isolation cut are configurable.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI have run this producer on a recent TTBar and HGG relval sample, and found that the producer produces the expected number of isolated photons in each case.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/28371\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1573836056", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "generators-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 28409, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "102X backport of isolated particle level photons", "updated_at": "1575310909", "user": "AndrewLevin"}
