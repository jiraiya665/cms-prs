Used mainly in ECAL DQM.\r\n- `setAccumulate` flag: basically unused, not sure what it was supposed to signal.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nRequires feedback from subsystem users, mainly ECAL (@tanmaymudholkar ?) regarding `softReset`. I suspect this PR will change behavior for ECAL online DQM.\r\n\r\nThe other user of `softReset` is `HLXMonitor`, which as far as I understand is history. Not sure if anybody feels responsible.\r\n\r\n`scaleElements` was called in the `MEtoEDM` workflow, so it might affect AlCa/PCL. I suspect it does not (I can't see any configuration for it, and I don't see what it would be good for), but it might be worth another check.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 75, "comments": 10, "commits": 14, "created_at": "1571832446", "deletions": 1416, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "hlt-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28247, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "DQM: Remove more DQMStore features", "updated_at": "1571905905", "user": "schneiml"}
