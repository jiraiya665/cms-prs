Now this is protected against going negative.\r\n+ also protect against negative energy scaling.\r\n   - Very rarely, charged hadron momentum scaling went negative, after rejecting of \"bad\" tracks. Now we protect against it as well. \r\n\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/832017/contributions/3485635/attachments/1871517/3102604/PF_NeutralHadron_CaloFractions_v4.pdf\r\nfor further information.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nIt compiles.
