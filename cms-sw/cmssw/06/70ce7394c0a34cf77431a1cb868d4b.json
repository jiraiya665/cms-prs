This templated class is similar to HadronizerFilter except it is thread-safe and can run the Hadronizer concurrently for different events.\r\n\r\nThe only hadronizer that has been instantiated is Pythia8 using a dummy decayer class, ConcurrentExternalDecayDriver. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code was tested using a production workflow snippet where the Pythia8Hadronizer was replaced with the ConcurrentPythia8Hadronizer. In the snippet, no external decayer was begin specified.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 5, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1581361150", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "generators-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28913, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "ConcurrentHadronizerFilter", "updated_at": "1581361615", "user": "Dr15Jones"}
