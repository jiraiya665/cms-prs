The fix was to not have a local variable holding the std::shared_ptr<> to the LuminosityBlockPrincipal. \r\nAdditionally, removed the unnecessary LuminosityBlockProcessingStatus arguments from streamEndLumiAsync.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI was able to modify one of the framework tests to be able to reliably fail. After this fix, it no longer fails.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1584659843", "deletions": 34, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "core-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29248, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix infrequent missing LuminosityBlock", "updated_at": "1584662824", "user": "Dr15Jones"}
