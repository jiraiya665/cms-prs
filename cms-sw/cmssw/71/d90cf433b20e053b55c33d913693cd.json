RunBUFU.sh in EventFilter/Utilities/test also runs fine.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 5, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1573139120", "deletions": 55, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "daq-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28359, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "(DAQ) Revert to untracked parameters and new configuration", "updated_at": "1573139989", "user": "smorovic"}
