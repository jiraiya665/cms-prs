No conflicts found so far.\r\nAlso, checked validation plots in digi and reco level to see change in detector behavior. No remarkable changes observed.\r\n\r\nNo significant increase in memory usage observed.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 72, "commits": 13, "created_at": "1564081278", "deletions": 18, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27616, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 19, "state": "open", "title": "Changes to make HGCDigitizerBase code run faster by reducing number of function calls generating Random numbers.", "updated_at": "1564603118", "user": "adas1994"}
