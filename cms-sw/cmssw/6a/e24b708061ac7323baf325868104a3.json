Arbitrary estimated couplings and a threshold are given as input parameters. Charges of marginal channels in a cluster are corrected wrt the couplings and the ones below the given threshold are set to zero. Clusters will be pruned if all channels of a row or column are zero and the cluster position will be recalculated.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code has been validated using two particle gun samples of 100 GeV muons at eta 0, one with no xtalk and one with 10% xtalk between pixels of odd rows and the next row.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 1, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1563966007", "deletions": 35, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27593, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Cmssw 11 0 xtalk correction", "updated_at": "1563966067", "user": "Arash-Jofrehei"}
