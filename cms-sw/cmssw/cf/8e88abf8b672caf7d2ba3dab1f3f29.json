T19 has 3D sensors (25x100) in\r\n TBPX L1 + TBPX L2 + TFPX R1\r\n * Add needed mechanisms to integrate the 3D description and new geometry\r\n (workflows, new module type, ..)\r\n * Not activating the template CPE reconstruction for 3D pixels\r\n * Inclusion of a new validator allowing to compare simulated digis with \r\n test beam data (not fully operational)\r\n\r\nThe work has not finished yet, still missing functionalities: \r\n * Specialize algorithm to the forward region\r\n * Study on the upstream reconstruction algorithms \r\n * Finish validation code  \r\n\r\n######  No expected changes in the ouput (3D pixels digis has the relaular PSimHits format)\r\n###### No externals nor PRs depends \r\n###### New 3D digitizer description: https://indico.cern.ch/event/848296/contributions/3580105/attachments/1917341/3170469/Pixels3D_inclusion_CMSSWW.pdf\r\n###### Tracker Layout with 3D sensors: https://indico.cern.ch/event/838963/contributions/3679017/attachments/1964989/3267164/ghugo.pdf\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n* Checked all dependencies, clean build, and all unit tests succeed, i.e over `CMSSW_11_1_X_2020-02-13-2300`, `scram b distclean; git cms-checkdeps -a -A; scram b` commands worked. \r\n* Some tests failed because problems with dataset not present  `scram b runtests` worked.  Looks like some sites has access problems. \r\n* All tests passed: `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos`\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 41, "comments": 4, "commits": 38, "created_at": "1582299319", "deletions": 31, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "geometry-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29018, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 8, "state": "open", "title": "Inclusion of Pixel 3D technology in the innermost layers of Phase 2 Inner Tracker", "updated_at": "1582490806", "user": "duartej"}
