At the same time, I looked at the spots where other part of cmssw depend on RecoEgamma and tried to remove these dependencies where possible. The ElectronIdentification and PhotonIdentification packages got special attention, and all sources in these libraries which are only used for plugins were moved into the plugins directory to make this more explicit.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles and local matrix tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 73, "comments": 10, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1577450167", "deletions": 1252, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "hlt-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28684, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "open", "title": "Reduce dependencies on RecoEgamma and requirements for RecoEgamma", "updated_at": "1577888712", "user": "guitargeek"}
