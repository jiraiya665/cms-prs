This will allow making some preliminary validation, even if also this has to be considered as a work in progress and not as a final validation suite for the full `HGCAL` reconstruction.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUsual limited `runTheMatrix`\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "comments": 2, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1580915495", "deletions": 114, "labels": ["code-checks-rejected", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28872, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Validation technical changes", "updated_at": "1580915894", "user": "rovere"}
