The code is not yet mature for a regular insertion in PyReleaseValidation, so I add a simple script to ```Geometry/CMSCommonData/test/dd4hep``` with the step1 cmsDriver command for a SingleMuon test workflow based on the 2021 DD4hep geometry made available.\r\n\r\nIn order to interface this seamlessly with ```ConfigBuilder.py``` without ad-hoc hacks, I update the name of ```DD4hep_GeometrySim_cff``` to the more standard ```GeometryDD4hepExtended2021_cff```, add a Reco counterpart of it, and plug this into ```Configuration/StandardSequences/python/GeometryConf_cff``` so as to let ```ConfigBuilder.py``` to pick it from the command line in a standard way.\r\n\r\nThe Reco configuration needs to be adapted further, as the test workflow is crashing in the HCAL part: @bsunanda do you see what is wrong?\r\n\r\nAt the same time I move the process modifier ```dd4hep_cff``` from ```Configuration/Eras``` where I had originally accepted it to ```Configuration/ProcessModifiers``` as it looks a more suitable location to me, in the spirit of #22718 . The places where this is added so far by @bsunanda are updated accordingly, and its use is also extended to the ```g4SimHits``` declaration.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with any link to  -->\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "comments": 1, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1580550560", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "geometry-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28847, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "cmsDriver Test workflow based on DD4hep: first steps", "updated_at": "1580550605", "user": "fabiocos"}
