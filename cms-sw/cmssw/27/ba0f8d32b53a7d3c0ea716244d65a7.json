The code is not yet mature for a regular insertion in PyReleaseValidation, so I add a simple script to ```Geometry/CMSCommonData/test/dd4hep``` with the step1 cmsDriver command for a SingleMuon test workflow based on the 2021 DD4hep geometry made available.\r\n\r\nIn order to interface this seamlessly with ```ConfigBuilder.py``` without ad-hoc hacks, I update the name of ```DD4hep_GeometrySim_cff``` to the more standard ```GeometryDD4hepExtended2021_cff```, add a Reco counterpart of it, and plug this into ```Configuration/StandardSequences/python/GeometryConf_cff``` so as to let ```ConfigBuilder.py``` to pick it from the command line in a standard way.\r\n\r\nThe Reco configuration needs to be adapted further, as the test workflow is crashing in the HCAL part: @bsunanda do you see what is wrong?\r\n\r\nAt the same time I move the process modifier ```dd4hep_cff``` from ```Configuration/Eras``` where I had originally accepted it to ```Configuration/ProcessModifiers``` as it looks a more suitable location to me, in the spirit of #22718 . The places where this is added so far by @bsunanda are updated accordingly, and its use is also extended to the ```g4SimHits``` declaration.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles, a test configuration is created but fails at runtime. It may be used to progressively test the completion of a geometry configuration fully operational for DD4hep.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "comments": 10, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1580550560", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "geometry-approved", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28847, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "cmsDriver Test workflow based on DD4hep: first steps", "updated_at": "1580744247", "user": "fabiocos"}
