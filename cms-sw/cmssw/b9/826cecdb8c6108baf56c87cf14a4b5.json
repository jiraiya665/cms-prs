Assuming that the intention was to check with `== 1` that the corresponding bit was set, and with `== 0 ` that it was not set, this PR suggests to replace the explicit bit operations with calls to `HcalChannelStatus::isBitSet()`. These were found by GCC 9.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code compiles without warnings with GCC 9.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1556307244", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26556, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix bit value checks in HcalNoiseInfoProducer", "updated_at": "1556307273", "user": "makortel"}
