It just kept trying to use the instance from thread 0 for all the threads.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPrivate testing with debug statements printing the thread counter and the SimProducer memory addresses, as well as tests on multiple threads and with helgrind.\r\n\r\nattn: @makortel @Dr15Jones", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1568076040", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27959, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "fix SimProducers for MT", "updated_at": "1568085373", "user": "kpedro88"}
