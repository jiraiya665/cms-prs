It clusters the final LHE particles using the anti-kt jet algorithm. A cut on the minimum pT > 350 GeV is selected. This filter is a loose pre-selection of the AK8-jet pT > 650 GeV filter at particle level used in the production of TT_AK8HT650* samples. The pre-filter selects at LHE level 99.8% of the events with a jet of pT > 650 GeV at particle level, while only 3% of the inclusive ttbar sample passes the filter. Therefore, the number of events that have to be showered before the filter decision is drastically reduced.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTests have shown that this pre-filter reduces the the run time per event from ~1.3s to ~0.2s.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 730, "comments": 0, "commits": 901, "created_at": "1566223548", "deletions": 9829, "labels": [], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27795, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Toplhefilter", "updated_at": "1566223571", "user": "ohindrichs"}
