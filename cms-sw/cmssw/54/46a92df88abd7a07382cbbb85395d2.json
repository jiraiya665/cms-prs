Those I changed to use their own SiStripDetInfoFile instance.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCompiled and ran unittests. Also checked that the configs for standalone use of the GeometricDet/TrackerGeometry work and give the same information, see [here](https://github.com/pieterdavid/SiStripLocalRecoDebugging/commit/04eb0e90a8187b4a778ea679c02d7b2a167be46e).\r\nI did however not run all configs that I edited (many are for standalone tests, production of conditions etc., and several looked quite outdated), so it would be great if the relevant people (Strip online/DAQ, tracker DQM etc.) could have a look at those.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 113, "comments": 2, "commits": 22, "created_at": "1561039116", "deletions": 514, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "code-checks-rejected", "comparison-pending", "db-pending", "dqm-pending", "geometry-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27292, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Remove SiStripDetInfoFileReader as an edm::Service", "updated_at": "1561039576", "user": "pieterdavid"}
