The motivation is to test mkFit within a customized HLT menu: mkFit needs all rphi+stereo hits as an input, but not the matched ones, and matching is rather expensive (as a reminder the current tracking creates the hit objects on the fly). In order to support the new parameter in existing HI HLT menus, I implemented `fillDescriptions()`. \r\n\r\nWhile at it, I decided to migrate the `SiStripRecHitConverter` to use ESGetToken. As a preparatory steps I did two modernizations: moved `TYPELOOKUP_DATA_REG` to its own file as suggested in the [EventSetup instructions](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideHowToRegisterESData), and removed the use of cached IDs as they're not really useful for just getting the EventSetup products.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nLimited matrix runs.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 8, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1574720108", "deletions": 55, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28471, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add a flag to disable matching in SiStripRecHitConverter", "updated_at": "1574792523", "user": "makortel"}
