This era contains the minimal modifications to produce a running workflow.  It uses the same modifiers as in the Run2_2018_pp_on_AA era, except it removes the HI-specific track MVA calibrations, which do not yet exist in a 2021 global tag.   For 2021 this is a reasonable starting point, as we expect the final PbPb workflow to be close to what was run in 2018.   The track MVA calibrations now default back to the pp ones, which means the track selections are too loose.  A possible temporary solution would be to tighten the values of the MVA selections to give more reasonable selections, while we wait for proper calibrations to become available.  \r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI tested workflow 158.1, substituting in the following flags:\r\n--beamspot Run3RoundOptics25ns13TeVLowSigmaZ\r\n--era Run3_PbPb\r\n--conditions auto:phase1_2021_realistic\r\nas well as replacing the HLT menu with HLT@fake2\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "comments": 2, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1582614759", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29032, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Minimal era for Run 3 PbPb", "updated_at": "1582614802", "user": "mandrenguyen"}
