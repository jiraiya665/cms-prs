Most of these refer to Phase 2 detector configurations that no longer exist, so it is not worth the effort to propagate the renaming. A few exceptions are made here for configs that may be used in unit tests.\r\n\r\nA mistake from #27449 in the D44 workflow (wrong version of the forward region) is also fixed.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nMatrix workflow 20034.0 runs successfully.\r\n\r\nUnit tests also run successfully.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 96, "comments": 4, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1562809211", "deletions": 405, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "geometry-rejected", "l1-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "upgrade-pending", "visualization-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27488, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 8, "state": "open", "title": "rename 2023 -> 2026, fix bug in D44", "updated_at": "1562848867", "user": "kpedro88"}
