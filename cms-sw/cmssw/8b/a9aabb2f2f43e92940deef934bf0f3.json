Most of these refer to Phase 2 detector configurations that no longer exist, so it is not worth the effort to propagate the renaming. A few exceptions are made here for configs that may be used in unit tests.\r\n\r\nA mistake from #27449 in the D44 workflow (wrong version of the forward region) is also fixed.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nMatrix workflow 20034.0 runs successfully.\r\n\r\nUnit tests also run successfully.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 102, "comments": 22, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1562809211", "deletions": 625, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "db-pending", "geometry-approved", "l1-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending", "visualization-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27488, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 12, "state": "open", "title": "rename 2023 -> 2026, fix bug in D44", "updated_at": "1562869629", "user": "kpedro88"}
