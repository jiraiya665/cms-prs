For previous scenarios and BTL the code has been left so far unchanged to make backward compatibility easier;\r\n\r\n- proton production cuts have been added (equal to electron cuts) as pointed by @ianna . The separation of BTL and ETL cuts, and the update of ETL cuts will be done in a separated PR;\r\n\r\n- ETLDetId has been updated by adding one more constructor, dedicated to the new ETL design.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe test class ```TestMTDPosition``` has been further updated, and all the test classes have been run to ensure that scenario D50 is left unchanged. The assignment of DetIds and corresponding definition of ```GeometricTimingDets``` in the scenario D53 appears consistent with the design implemented by @icosivi .", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "comments": 1, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1584286023", "deletions": 85, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "geometry-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29207, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "MTD geometry: updates of xml and RECO geometry for new TDR ETL", "updated_at": "1584286066", "user": "fabiocos"}
