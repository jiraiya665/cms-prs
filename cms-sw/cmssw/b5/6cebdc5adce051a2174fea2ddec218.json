This header contains metadata description of the content (file size without header and number of events, LS and versioning). Aim is to replace separate JSON file which can take a lot of space in ramdisk with 2 MB huge pages (minimum per file).\r\n\r\nFile broker will switch protocol to v2 when detecting raw files with header, and Input source assumes i in this case . In addition there is also format autodetection when using fileListMode and in FRDSource, as well as generation support for the new format in the fake BU module.\r\n\r\nAdditional optimization is added: input source will, in case of using a single reader thread with double buffering (default mode), open raw file only once and reuse the same FD to read file sequentially until done (reducing number file operations performed).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis has been developed and tested in DAQ3VAL system.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "comments": 2, "commits": 18, "created_at": "1565602212", "deletions": 75, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "core-pending", "daq-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27750, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Adding FRD file header (DAQ)", "updated_at": "1565602293", "user": "smorovic"}
