This is needed to apply Autumn18_V7 JER-SF, released last week.\r\nEnable phi-dependent jet energy scale in PAT. This will be needed for 2018 JEC to deal with the HEM issue.\r\nThis PR has no impact with the current global tags in any release. However, it will enable using a new global tag (currently in the makings) with pt-dependent JER-SFs and later with phi-dependent JECs.\r\n\r\nA test config to apply resolution smearing from a db file has been added under /test.\r\nHere is an example db-file containing pt-dependent JER-SFs:\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-jet/JRDatabase/blob/master/SQLiteFiles/Autumn18_V7_MC.db\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTest config runs after inclusion of this PR. It was checked that this does not change the memory consumption, compared to using the old code with Autumn18_V1_MC.db (no pt-dependence).\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nBackport of #28096\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1569917692", "deletions": 566, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 28098, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Enable pt-dependent JER-SF and phi-dependent JEC application in PAT [102X backport]", "updated_at": "1570089325", "user": "ahinzmann"}
