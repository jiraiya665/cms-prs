Much of it could be found in the classes `BarrelMeasurementEstimator` and `ForwardMeasurementEstimator`, which unnecessarily inherit from `MeasurementEstimator` and only one of their respective member functions is actually used. Whether a track extrapolation falls into the matching window in the next layer.\r\n\r\nI propose to integrate the remaining functionality of these estimator classes after cleaning them up as private functors of the `PixelHitMatcher` class. Sorry for having multiple of these small cleanup PRs, but I don't want to risk any differences in the comparisons by doing to much at once and possibly making mistakes.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles and local matrix tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 8, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1571927212", "deletions": 425, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28262, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Merged the MeasurementEstimators into the PixelHitMatcher", "updated_at": "1571938247", "user": "guitargeek"}
