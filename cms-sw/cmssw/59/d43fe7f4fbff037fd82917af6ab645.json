The old patterns are defined as 1D arrays with length 42. This will change to 2D vector with width 11 and depth 6. More details can be found here [1], page 3-8. The Run-3 patterns have previously been defined in #28600. Because this PR merely replace the 1D array with a 2D vector, there should be no changes in the output. \r\n\r\nI also remove very outdated code (pre-2007) in the CSCCommonTrigger and CSCTrackFinder packages (`NUM_CLCT_PATTERNS_PRE_TMB07`)\r\n\r\n[1]\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/882849/contributions/3722003/attachments/1977056/3296463/CSCTriggerPlans2020_SvenDildick_L1TDPG.pdf\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with wf 22034.0.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nFYI @tahuang1991 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "comments": 20, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1580525216", "deletions": 145, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28846, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Cast legacy CSC trigger patterns in Run-3 pattern format", "updated_at": "1582033880", "user": "dildick"}
