However, I'm not sure if the comparisons would catch possible problems. Is the channel recovery now enabled by default so the matrix tests would capture possible differences? That would make validating this PR easier.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 39, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1568984199", "deletions": 78, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28040, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Migrate EcalDeadChannelRecoveryBDTG to GBRForest", "updated_at": "1578680728", "user": "guitargeek"}
