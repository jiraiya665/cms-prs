I largely relied on `sed` to make the (trivial) changes:\r\n```\r\nsed -i 's/->bestALCT\\[/->getBestALCT(/g' *.cc\r\nsed -i 's/->bestCLCT\\[/->getBestCLCT(/g' *.cc\r\nsed -i 's/->secondALCT\\[/->getSecondALCT(/g' *.cc\r\nsed -i 's/->secondCLCT\\[/->getSecondCLCT(/g' *.cc\r\nsed -i 's/(bx_alct\\]/(bx_alct)/g' *.cc\r\nsed -i 's/(bx_clct\\]/(bx_clct)/g' *.cc\r\n```\r\n\r\nUpdate: upon further inspection, it appears that the CLCT BX shift in PR#24402 was incomplete. The public variables `bestCLCT` and `secondCLCT` would return CLCTs at central BX7. The new public functions `getBestCLCT()` and `getSecondCLCT()` return CLCTs with central BX8. However, the CLCT readout remains unchanged, i.e. it will produce produce the CLCT digi collection with a central BX of 7. Also, this change won't have an effect on the LCT reconstruction efficiency, since the ALCT-CLCT BX matching window is at least 3 to 7 BX wide.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI tested it with WF 22034.0\r\n\r\n@tahuang1991 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "comments": 7, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1568040442", "deletions": 146, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27956, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Replace public variable with public function in CSC TP emulator", "updated_at": "1568079967", "user": "dildick"}
