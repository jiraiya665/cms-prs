A quick summary of the improvements in this regard:\r\n\r\n   * Fix the score definition that was wrong in both cases. In particular, changes to the overall normalization were needed.\r\n   * Fix the computation of the fraction of the shared energy between a `Trackster` and its linked `CaloParticles`\r\n   * Review the definitions of _merge_, _duplicate_ and _fake_ rate for the `Trackster` validation. Once this PR will be merged, the accompanying documentation at [this link](https://hgcal.web.cern.ch) will be updated.\r\n   * Add the possibility to run the validation on several `Tracksters` collections in a more or less transparent way. **More changes are foreseen for the future** (in separate PRs), namely:\r\n      * separate the _association code_ from the _validation code_, creating ad-hoc `EDProducers` for that purpose;\r\n      * improve the overall `python` definition of parameters and the accompanying `C++` code;\r\n      * improve the python plotting capabilities.\r\n   * The improved `Trackster` validation, when tested on closeby samples, allowed for better tuning of the cuts of the electromagnetic `TICL` iteration.\r\n\r\nWe expect differences in `Tracksters`' output for the electromagnetic iteration and, also, changes in few histograms (binning and naming)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with:\r\n   * `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos`\r\n   * `runTheMatrix.py -w upgrade -l 20493.51,20493.52`\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "comments": 7, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1571980853", "deletions": 258, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-notrun", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-rejected", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28265, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Improve Score Definition and EM Trackster Reconstruction", "updated_at": "1571993538", "user": "rovere"}
