The idea is that the pileup response, that has been simulated with a given transparency for ECAL crystals, will be scaled to match the transparency of the corresponding IOV.\r\nA new object is introduced ( EcalLaserAPDPNRatiosMCRcd ), that has 1 single IOV, thus allowing this to be used as reference for scaling.\r\nGoal: correct simulation of the photostatistics for pileup, when producing run dependent MC with several IOVs (main changes in run dependent MC for ECAL are transparency and noise).\r\n\r\nThis PR is needed for testing via relval, checking physics performance and possibly imploved data-MC comparison.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "comments": 11, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1571410412", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-notrun", "db-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-rejected", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28214, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Premix option c, with 2 tags, ECAL, 11_0_X, no new object for apdpnMC", "updated_at": "1571427839", "user": "amassiro"}
