(Similar to how a CSCSegment has access to the CSCRecHit2Ds.) The relevant change is in function `patternFinding`, which called for both the trigger and the pre-trigger.  This function now also identifies all hits that were part of a particular pattern. An intermediate pattern map keeps track of all comparator hits, for each key half-strip and for each pattern Id. Ultimately, only the comparator hits for the best pattern are stored in the CLCT. \r\n\r\nNo changes to the actual trigger logic have been made. No changes are expected in the output. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with WF 22034.0.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n@tahuang1991 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 6, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1584562202", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29233, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Store comparator hits in the CLCT pattern (CCLUT-4)", "updated_at": "1584628467", "user": "dildick"}
