We essentially tell the compiler to open the definition from a module rather than parsing.\r\n\r\nPart of #15248\r\n\r\ncc: @davidlange6, @smuzaffar, @oshadura", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1581436320", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28925, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[cxxmodules] Workaround missing CLHEP modulemap.", "updated_at": "1581436369", "user": "vgvassilev"}
