If the user requests a luminosity value that is accumulated in the middle of the year, the darkening must be evaluated using a partial luminosity value for the last year. This computation was done incorrectly, which manifested as larger-than-expected response correction factors (seen in https://indico.cern.ch/event/844333/contributions/3546577/attachments/1900343/3136629/Phase_2_conditions_update.pdf). The calculation has now been fixed and confirmed to be correct.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan the test analyzer [hbhedarkeninganalyzer_cfg.py](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/CalibCalorimetry/HcalPlugins/test/hbhedarkeninganalyzer_cfg.py) to check the output at various intermediate luminosity values.\r\n\r\nattn: @abdoulline", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1567532919", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "db-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27922, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "fix handling of intermediate lumi values in HCAL aging", "updated_at": "1567533274", "user": "kpedro88"}
