As changing python means rebuilding nearly half of externals, so we propose to integrate some cleanup from CC8 branch which includes\r\n- Delete unused specs/files\r\n- Cleanup for geting config.gues and config.sub files\r\n- Use build in PRM macros instead of custom one\r\n- Remove explicit generation of dependencies-setup.*sh files\r\n- Fixing autotools to use included xml instead of looking at system headers\r\n- Make sure to fail is pip can not find a installed package name\r\n- Backports:\r\n  - cmsos changes\r\n  - git version 2.23\r\n  - pcre version 8.43\r\n- Drop Qt and PyQt ( as part of Qt cleanup https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/28436 )\r\n- Unify Zlib build for x86_64 and non-x86_64 archs\r\n- Drop thriftpy it has been deprecated and does not build with new python 3.8. Although there is thriftpy2 but as non of our externals require it so we propose to remove it.", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_11_1_X/master", "changed_files": 107, "comments": 15, "commits": 19, "created_at": "1584296965", "deletions": 1575, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "externals-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-started"], "number": 5648, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Python 3.8.2: updates (git, pcre) and cleanups (qt, pyqt, thriftpy) ", "updated_at": "1584434655", "user": "smuzaffar"}
