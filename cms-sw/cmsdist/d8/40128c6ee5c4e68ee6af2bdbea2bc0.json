I tried to update curl to the same version used in the CMSSW branch, but I get failures building webdoc and/or dqmgui (no clue what the problem is).\r\n\r\nCould you please test this PR - install WMAgent for instance, load the libraries and run your snippet to test DNS queries - and follow up any further changes that become necessary?\r\n\r\nYou can use my private repo: http://cmsrep.cern.ch/cgi-bin/repos/comp.amaltaro/slc7_amd64_gcc630?C=M;O=D\r\n\r\nwhich has packages built with the new pycurl version. If you want to install WMAgent, you need to provide version `1.2.8-comp8`.\r\nThanks", "branch": "comp_gcc630", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1576139868", "deletions": 49, "labels": [], "number": 5420, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Update PycURL to 7.43.0.3 and build with pip", "updated_at": "1576139868", "user": "amaltaro"}
